"""Runner-engine compatibility assertion.

Chosen shape: startup compatibility assertion (compat-assert).

Tradeoff rationale
------------------
Three shapes were available to close the version-skew window:

1. **Pin the dep to a commit/tag** — closes the window structurally but
   requires a manual bump every time the engine changes.  Release-flow cost:
   whoever merges an engine PR must also bump the runner's pinned commit in
   ``pipeline-runner/pyproject.toml`` and cut a new release.  In a fast-moving
   repo with a single maintainer this is a constant friction tax and a known
   source of forgotten bumps.

2. **Collapse to a single package** — eliminates the skew problem entirely but
   is a larger refactor that changes the module boundary and the install story
   (users who want only the engine can no longer install it without the runner).
   Deferred: the boundary is intentional (engine is usable standalone).

3. **Startup compatibility assertion (chosen)** — keeps the floating dep but
   adds a check at runner startup that probes for a known-new symbol and fails
   loudly with an actionable message before any node runs.  The skew window
   still exists in theory (a stale cache could still be resolved), but it is
   detected immediately rather than mid-run, and the error message names both
   the required version and the resolution command.  This is the lowest
   friction shape for a single-repo, actively-developed package.

``amplifier-foundation``: published float, resolver-local pin
--------------------------------------------------------------
The ``amplifier-foundation`` dep in ``pipeline-runner/pyproject.toml`` is
declared in two places on purpose, and the split is the whole design:

* ``[project].dependencies`` -- ``@main``.  This is what consumers resolve.
* ``[tool.uv] override-dependencies`` -- a SHA.  This is what *we* resolve.

**Why the published requirement must float.**  uv identifies a git dependency
by its *ref string*, not by the commit that ref resolves to.  Two requirements
for the same package whose ref strings differ are a hard resolution error --
``Requirements contain conflicting URLs for package `amplifier-foundation``` --
even when one ref is an ancestor of the other.  Every other
``amplifier-foundation`` declaration in the ecosystem (this repo's bundle
includes, ``amplifier-app-wiki-weaver``, and downstream of it ``repo-weaver``)
names ``@main``, so any non-``@main`` ref on the published line makes
pipeline-runner un-co-installable with all of them.  A SHA pin on that line did
exactly that and blocked every fresh wiki-weaver install by every install verb
(#213).  A release tag would fail identically -- ``@v2.1.2`` is just as
different from ``@main`` as a SHA is -- and a bare version range cannot resolve
at all, since foundation publishes no artifacts to PyPI.  So the published line
is not a preference; it is the only ref that co-resolves.

**Why the pin still exists.**  The original problem
(microsoft-amplifier/amplifier-support#391, PR #201) is real: this repo commits
no lockfile, so an unconstrained ``@main`` meant every CI run re-resolved
foundation's live tip and an upstream change could redden CI with no local
change.  ``[tool.uv] override-dependencies`` closes that window without
touching what anybody else resolves.  uv applies an override only to the
project it is resolving as *root* -- precisely how CI consumes this module
(``uv sync`` with ``working-directory: modules/pipeline-runner``) -- and does
not apply it when this package is somebody else's dependency.  CI gets a fixed
foundation commit; consumers get plain ``@main``.

**Two mechanisms that look right and are not** (both measured, so nobody has to
re-derive them):

* ``[tool.uv.sources]`` with a ``rev`` does *not* stay local.  uv reads a git
  dependency's sources straight out of its checked-out ``pyproject.toml``, so
  the rev reappears in the dependent's resolution and the conflict returns
  verbatim -- even though the *built wheel's* ``Requires-Dist`` says ``@main``.
* ``[tool.uv] constraint-dependencies`` cannot carry a git ref at all: a URL in
  a constraint is itself a second conflicting URL for the package, so the
  resolver rejects it before it can constrain anything.

**Bump procedure.**  Update the SHA in ``[tool.uv] override-dependencies`` of
``pipeline-runner/pyproject.toml`` -- *not* the ``[project].dependencies``
line, which must stay ``@main`` -- then verify against this module's test suite
(``uv run pytest -q`` in ``modules/pipeline-runner``).  Bumping is CI-hygiene
work only; it changes nothing for installed users, who track foundation
``main`` and are guarded by the startup assertion below.  Apply the
compat-assert pattern to a foundation symbol the moment the runner starts
depending on a recently-added one (today it uses only long-stable core API --
``Bundle``, ``load_bundle``, imported lazily inside functions, and this
module's own suite exercises them through a stand-in -- so there is no
discriminating symbol to probe).
