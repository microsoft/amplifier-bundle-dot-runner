"""Reusable engine harness: run an arbitrary attractor DOT pipeline.

Two-layer public API:

* ``drive_engine`` -- low-level. Caller supplies an already-built
  ``coordinator`` (with ``session.spawn`` already registered on it) and this
  function parses/transforms/validates the graph, seeds context, and drives
  ``PipelineEngine`` directly. This is the seam a consumer with its own
  session/bundle lifecycle (e.g. an existing resolver) plugs into.
* ``run_pipeline`` -- high-level convenience. Builds the prepared bundle,
  session, and spawn wiring itself, then calls ``drive_engine``. This is what
  the CLI uses.

Extracted from dot-graph-runner's ``dot_graph_runner/runner.py`` (~429 lines),
split into this two-function shape per the attractor-runner design (slice 0).
Uses ONLY the attractor engine's public modules
(``amplifier_module_loop_pipeline.{context,dot_parser,engine,handlers,backend,
validation,transforms}``).

Why the direct-engine path: the mounted loop-pipeline orchestrator (driven via
``session.execute()``) builds its own internal ``PipelineContext`` and exposes
``params`` only as a nested dict for LLM-prompt ``$key`` expansion -- there is
no seam to seed flat context keys that way, so a ``--param`` would never reach
``tool_command``/``tool_env``. Driving the engine directly is what lets a
``--param`` reach a tool node.

Every LLM (``box``) node spawns a full ``attractor-agent-*`` coding agent (its
own ``loop-agent`` orchestrator + filesystem/bash/search tools) via the
``session.spawn`` capability -- true of the ``attractor`` CLI personality
only. The ``dot-runner`` personality (``engine_native=True`` below; DESIGN-
worker-registry-core-split.md P3) never registers ``session.spawn`` and never
loads that agent-carrying bundle: every ``box`` node runs through the worker
registry's ``direct`` worker instead (unified-llm-client + a provider key).

    ``ModuleNotFoundError`` mid-pipeline.  This covers both the CLI path and

    Low-level API: the caller is responsible for building the session and
    registering ``session.spawn`` on ``coordinator`` before calling this
    (see ``run_pipeline`` for the high-level convenience that does this).

    Backend / session.spawn wiring (the part that had to be gotten right):
    ``AmplifierBackend._run_with_spawn`` (backend.py) obtains everything it
    needs from the ``coordinator`` object passed to ``AmplifierBackend()``:
      - ``coordinator.get_capability("session.spawn")`` -- the spawn fn.
      - ``getattr(coordinator, "session", None)`` -- the parent session for
        lineage tracking.
      - ``getattr(coordinator, "config", None).get("agents", {})`` -- the
        per-profile agent configs, used both to resolve which bundle to
        spawn and for the recursion guard (each entry must carry an inline
        non-pipeline ``session.orchestrator``).
    The caller's ``coordinator`` must already satisfy all three lookups
    (this is naturally true of a coordinator built via
    ``PreparedBundle.create_session()`` against the attractor-pipeline
    bundle -- see ``run_pipeline``).

    Args:
        graph_or_dot: A parsed ``Graph``, or raw DOT source text to parse.
        coordinator: An already-built coordinator with ``session.spawn``
            already registered on it.
        params: Flat key->value params seeded into context (see
            ``seed_context``). Also reaches LLM ``box`` prompts via
            ``graph.params_values``.
        cwd: Working directory for the pipeline (tool/box nodes write here).
            Defaults to ``Path.cwd()`` if not given.
        logs_root: Directory for this run's engine logs.
        hooks: Optional hooks object forwarded to the handler registry and engine.
        profiles: llm_provider -> agent-name routing map. Defaults to
            ``DEFAULT_PROFILES`` if not given.
        interviewer: Optional interviewer object forwarded to the handler
            registry (human-in-the-loop gate seam).
        transform: Required keyword. If True, run ``apply_transforms`` on the
            graph before validation/execution (stylesheet routing only fires
            if the graph sets ``model_stylesheet``).
        validate: If True (default), run ``validate_or_raise`` on the graph
            before execution -- fails loud on graph-shape problems before
            spending an LLM call.
        resume_checkpoint: A ``Checkpoint`` that has ALREADY passed the resume
            validation ladder's rungs 1-5
            (``checkpoint.load_checkpoint_for_resume``). When given, this
            drives ``engine.resume(...)`` instead of ``engine.run()``, after
            running the ladder's rung 6 (structural validity) against the
            parsed+transformed graph this call is about to execute -- that
            rung needs the real graph, which only exists at this point.
            ``None`` (the default) is the fresh path: nothing here reads a
            checkpoint, so a stale or foreign ``checkpoint.json`` in
            ``logs_root`` cannot affect the run.

    The recursion-avoidance mechanism: every child agent must carry an inline

    (``loop-agent``). Without it the spawned child inherits the parent's
    ``loop-pipeline`` orchestrator and re-runs the whole DOT (infinite

    Layer-1 (the child's base/system prompt) is delivered by ``loop-agent``'s
    provider-default selection (``context/system-<provider>.md``, chosen from
    the child's ``providers``), or by an explicit ``system_prompt`` /
    ``system_prompt_file`` in the child's orchestrator config. ``loop-agent``
    is fail-loud on an empty Layer-1, so a successful spawn proves the real
    prompt was resolved. Agent ``context.include`` is deliberately NOT
    processed here -- ``loop-agent`` treats context includes as additive
    context, never as Layer-1, and every attractor agent leans on the
    provider default.

    The legacy ``{"bundle": "attractor:agents/<name>"}`` reference shape is no

    """Build the ``session.spawn`` capability for a prepared bundle.

    Adapted from dot-graph-runner's ``make_spawn_fn``. Each pipeline node
    spawns a full child sub-session built from one of the bundle's
    per-provider agents (resolved to its own ``loop-agent`` orchestrator +
    tools).

    This signature matches what ``AmplifierBackend._run_with_spawn`` calls
    (amplifier_module_loop_pipeline/backend.py) regardless of whether the
    engine is driven via the mounted orchestrator or directly -- the spawn
    capability itself is unchanged by that switch.

    ``cwd`` is the pipeline working directory (``--cwd``). It is threaded
    explicitly into every box-node child session as ``session_cwd`` so the
    agent's filesystem/bash tools are rooted at ``--cwd`` -- mirroring how
    tool nodes get ``context.target_dir`` set explicitly. Without this,
    ``PreparedBundle.spawn`` falls back to inheriting the parent session's
    working_dir, which is fragile and leaves box nodes writing to the
    process cwd instead of ``--cwd``. This is the load-bearing host/DTU cwd
    fix -- preserve the ``session_cwd=cwd`` argument exactly.

    ``child_constraint`` (optional) is a caller-supplied hook that receives
    the resolved child ``Bundle`` and returns a (possibly modified) child
    ``Bundle`` -- the generic seam a consumer uses to constrain a spawned
    agent (e.g. a filesystem sandbox that denies writes to protected paths,
    or a read-only tool set for an ask-style pipeline). It is applied AFTER
    the per-agent resolve cache, so the constraint can depend on run-scoped
    state (the cache holds the unconstrained resolve; the constraint is
    re-applied cheaply per spawn). The runner itself stays domain-agnostic --
    it never inspects what the constraint does.

    ``spawn_timeout`` (optional) wraps each child spawn in
    ``asyncio.wait_for`` -- a long-running box node that hangs then fails
    loud rather than blocking the whole pipeline forever. ``None`` (default)
    means no timeout.

    """Resume an interrupted pipeline run from its checkpoint (spec §5.3).

    The explicit, opt-in counterpart to ``run_pipeline``.  ``run_pipeline``
    never reads a checkpoint back — resume happens here or not at all, which
    is what makes a stale or foreign ``checkpoint.json`` inert to a fresh run
    by construction rather than by a guard that can misfire.

    The run continues IN PLACE in ``run_dir`` (spec §5.6 / rule 1: the
    checkpoint IS ``{logs_root}/checkpoint.json``, and a resumed run is the
    same execution continued).  ``trace.jsonl`` appends after the interrupted
    records, ``manifest.json`` gains a ``resumes`` entry, and the completed
    nodes' directories are left untouched.

    IMPORTANT for callers: resume from the SAME working directory the
    interrupted run used.  File state produced by tool/agent nodes lives
    there, and the engine cannot verify it — this is the boundary where the
    graph-owned idempotency pattern (``examples/pipelines/12-graph-resume.dot``)
    is the right complementary tool.

    Args:
        run_dir: The interrupted run's ``logs_root`` — the directory holding
            ``checkpoint.json``.
        dot_source: Optional DOT source, for provenance/auditing.  It MUST
            fingerprint-match the checkpoint's embedded source or the resume
            is refused (a checkpoint binds to the run that wrote it; there is
            deliberately no override flag).  When omitted, the checkpoint's
            own embedded source is used — resume is self-contained.
        params: Additional flat context params.  A param may only ADD keys:
            colliding with a key the checkpoint restores is a loud error, not
            a silent shadow of restored state.
        cwd: Working directory for the resumed run.  Behaves exactly as on
            ``run_pipeline`` (process-level wiring cannot be serialized).
        provider, profiles, hooks, interviewer, transform, validate,
        extra_overlays, child_constraint, spawn_timeout: as ``run_pipeline``.

    Returns:
        A ``PipelineResult`` whose ``logs_dir`` is ``run_dir``.

    Raises:
        CheckpointResumeError: any rung of the validation ladder — missing,
            corrupted, wrong schema, already completed, graph mismatch, or
            structurally invalid.  Never a silent fresh start.
        ValueError: a ``--param`` collides with restored context state.
