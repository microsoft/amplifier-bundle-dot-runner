"""Unit tests for the run_pipeline consumer seam on ``_build_prepared``'s
``extra_overlays`` parameter.

``extra_overlays`` is the generic seam a consumer (e.g. the wiki-weaver
consumer) uses to add cross-cutting configuration to every session and
spawned child -- e.g. mounting an observability hook -- without the runner
needing to know what the overlay contains. These tests assert that each
overlay supplied is genuinely composed onto the runtime bundle, in order,
after the runtime orchestrator overlay -- i.e. it actually reaches the
prepared bundle used to build the session, not merely accepted and dropped.
They use fakes and monkeypatching (no real bundle loading, no engine, no
LLM) so they stay fast and non-brittle, per the module's testing philosophy.
