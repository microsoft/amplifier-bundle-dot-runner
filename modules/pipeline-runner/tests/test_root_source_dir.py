"""A file-backed ROOT graph must carry the directory it was read from.

The bug: ``resolve_dot_path`` (loop-pipeline ``handlers/pipeline.py``) is a
precedence chain, not a search path -- it never checks existence, so the first
non-empty candidate wins:

    absolute -> graph.source_dir -> context.target_dir -> os.getcwd()

A root graph loaded from a file arrived with ``source_dir`` empty, because the
CLI reads the DOT as text and the path is discarded. ``--cwd`` sets
``context.target_dir``. So a root graph's relative ``dot_file=`` children were
looked for under the WORKING DIRECTORY rather than beside the pipeline, and
running a multi-file pipeline against a separate workspace required flattening
its DOT tree into that workspace.

Child graphs were never affected (``PipelineHandler.execute`` sets
``child_graph.source_dir``), nor were remote packages (they derive theirs from
the materialized entry). Only the root's first hop.

SCOPE: this covers the standalone CLI path -- ``attractor run <file>``. The
mounted ``PipelineOrchestrator`` also reads a local ``dot_file`` into text and
discards the path; that path is deliberately NOT changed here.

The directory is applied in the runner's ``_load_graph`` rather than passed
into the engine helper on purpose -- see the note there. Runner and engine are
separately resolved packages, and ``compat.py`` asserts symbol presence, not
signatures, so a new engine parameter would be a skew the gate cannot see.
