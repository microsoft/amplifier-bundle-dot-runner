"""Integration test: console-mode human gate driven end-to-end through the
runner's real engine machinery, with a REAL ``ConsoleInterviewer`` (never
mocked) and only ``sys.stdin`` faked (piped, scripted input).

This proves the ``--on-human-gate console`` wiring does real stdin-driven
edge selection -- not a silent auto-approve/first-choice fallback -- by
running a minimal two-choice hexagon gate and asserting the SECOND choice's
edge is the one actually taken when "B\\n" is piped in.

Spec basis (contracts/external/attractor-spec-canonical.md, identical to the
fresh upstream clone at attractor/attractor-spec.md):
    Section 6.1  -- Interviewer interface (``ask``/``ask_multiple``/``inform``).
    Section 6.4  -- "ConsoleInterviewer (CLI): Reads from standard input.
                     Displays formatted prompts with option keys."
    Conformance checklist (~line 1865): "ConsoleInterviewer prompts in
                     terminal and reads user input."
    Section 9.5  -- human gates must be operable via CLI.

Uses ``drive_engine`` (the low-level seam ``run_pipeline``/the CLI itself
build on -- see runner.py's module docstring) with a bare ``coordinator``
stand-in: this graph has no box/agent nodes, so the coordinator is never
touched (only the human-gate handler and exit handler fire).
