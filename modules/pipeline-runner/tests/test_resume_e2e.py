"""End-to-end resume: a real process, really killed, really resumed (issue #224).

The interruption here is not simulated. The test launches `attractor run` as a
child process in its own process group, waits until a mid-graph node has
actually started (and therefore the previous node's checkpoint has landed),
SIGKILLs the whole group, and then invokes `attractor resume` as a genuinely
separate process.

Equivalence is asserted against an uninterrupted CONTROL run that this gate
executes itself, at gate runtime — never against a committed golden.

Fixture graphs are deterministic and tool-only (no LLM, no network) except the
rule-6 fidelity test, which drives LLM-shaped nodes through a stub backend
supplied via the stack's public backend-injection surface (a coordinator whose
`session.spawn` capability is the stub, driven through `drive_engine`).
