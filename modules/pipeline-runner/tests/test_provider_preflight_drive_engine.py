"""drive_engine startup provider preflight (issue #155).

The incident invoker was exactly this path: an opinionated CLI personality ->
run_pipeline -> drive_engine with a profiles map naming all three providers
(the attractor pattern's own provider->agent routing, supplied explicitly
here -- drive_engine itself carries no such default post band-aid-rip). The
'openai' PROFILE existed, but no OPENAI_API_KEY did -- so the critique_b node
crashed on every visit (`resolve_latest_for: no adapter found for provider
'openai'`) and the graph's transient-recovery routing drained the entire
iteration budget against a defect that had nothing to do with the work.

These tests pin the fix: drive_engine now refuses AT STARTUP -- before any
node executes, before any LLM call -- naming the node, the provider, and the
missing credential.

Issue #283 adds the second half of that refusal on this path.  #195/#280
closed the "key set but the profile names an ABSENT agent" hole at
``PipelineOrchestrator.execute()``; drive_engine still passed no
``resolvable_profiles``, so the original #155 incident invoker stayed
fail-open for exactly that class: profile mapped + credential set + named
agent absent -> accepted at startup -> every visit fails at spawn -> the
budget drains to the engine's 200-step safety bound.  The tests below pin
BOTH directions: the refusal, and -- the crux, the #196 disease inverse --
that a run which WOULD work is still not refused.
