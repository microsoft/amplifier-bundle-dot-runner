"""Lock the spec §3.7 fail-fast guard in select_edge.

Spec §3.7 (fail-fast intent): when a node returns FAIL, the engine looks for
an explicit failure path (condition="outcome=fail" edges, retry_target,
fallback_retry_target) and terminates if none exists.

These tests ensure that select_edge() enforces §3.7 by returning None for
FAIL outcomes when only unconditional edges are available — while keeping
SUCCESS routing and explicit failure-path routing unchanged.

Spec coverage: §3.7 (fail-fast intent), §3.3 (RETURN NONE), ESEL-002.
