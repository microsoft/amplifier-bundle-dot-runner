"""Regression test for a leak-window bug in the mounted PipelineOrchestrator.

Covers a bug found during Task 12 verification: in the ``git+https://`` branch
of ``PipelineOrchestrator.execute()``, the materialize call and the parse of
the materialized entry happened *outside* the outer try/finally that runs
``_source_cleanup()``. If ``materialize_remote_dot`` succeeded (real cleanup
callback assigned) but the subsequent ``parse_dot(...)`` call raised, the
exception propagated from outside the try/finally and cleanup never ran,
leaking the per-run materialized view directory on disk.

The fix wraps just the materialize->parse window in its own try/except that
calls cleanup and re-raises. That sequence now lives in the single shared
``remote_dot.load_remote_or_local_graph`` helper used by both this mounted
hook and the sibling direct-engine hook in
``amplifier_module_pipeline_runner.runner._load_graph`` -- see that
function's docstring for why the two were unified.
