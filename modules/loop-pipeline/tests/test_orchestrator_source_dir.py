"""The mounted PipelineOrchestrator must preserve a file-backed root graph's
source directory, the second of the two remaining partial-coverage-symmetry
(AGENTS.md S4) sites for this bug -- the standalone CLI path was already
fixed (see ``pipeline-runner``'s ``test_root_source_dir.py``).

This file also owns the CONSUMING-side end-to-end proof for the third site,
the agent-facing ``run_pipeline`` tool (``tool-pipeline-run``). That tool
does not depend on this package (AGENTS.md's dependency-awareness rule --
``tool-pipeline-run``'s ``pyproject.toml`` declares only ``amplifier-core``),
so it cannot construct or run a real ``PipelineOrchestrator`` in its own
suite. Its own tests instead assert on the ``orchestrator_config`` dict it
builds -- ``{"dot_source": <text>, "source_dir": <dir>}`` -- for a file-backed
``dot_file`` input; see
``modules/tool-pipeline-run/tests/test_source_dir_propagation.py``.
``test_execute_resolves_relative_child_via_dot_source_and_source_dir`` below
closes the loop from this side: it hands ``PipelineOrchestrator`` that exact
config shape directly (no cross-module import needed, since it's just a
dict) and proves the relative ``dot_file=`` child actually loads and
executes -- the same proof the two modules previously duplicated via a
cross-module import that broke CI (see that file's docstring for the
incident).

The bug: ``resolve_dot_path`` (``handlers/pipeline.py``) is a precedence
chain, not a search path -- the first non-empty candidate wins:

    absolute -> graph.source_dir -> context.target_dir -> os.getcwd()

``PipelineOrchestrator.execute()`` reads a local ``dot_file`` as text via
``self.config.get("dot_file")`` and discarded the directory, so a mounted
pipeline's relative ``dot_file=`` children were looked for under
``os.getcwd()`` (there is no ``context.target_dir`` at this layer) instead
of beside the pipeline that was actually invoked.

Child graphs were never affected (``PipelineHandler.execute`` sets
``child_graph.source_dir``), nor were remote packages (they derive theirs
from the materialized entry). Only the root's first hop -- same shape as the
CLI bug, different entry point.
