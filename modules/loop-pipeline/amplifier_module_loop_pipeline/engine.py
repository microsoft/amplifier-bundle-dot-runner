        ``fidelity=full`` continuity is an in-memory transcript replayed into a
        fresh spawn (``AmplifierBackend._thread_transcripts``).  A killed
        process loses it unrecoverably, so without this the first resumed
        ``full`` hop would silently spawn with empty history — "proceeds as if
        nothing degraded", which is precisely what must not happen.

        Trigger, stated openly: we degrade when the first resumed hop itself
        RESOLVES to ``full``.  The spec's literal trigger is "if the PREVIOUS
        node used full"; the two readings differ only where the literal one
        does nothing useful — if this hop resolves to any non-``full`` mode it
        already gets a fresh session with a preamble, so substituting
        ``summary:high`` would be a no-op or an override of an explicit author
        choice.  Ours additionally covers the lost-transcript case the literal
        trigger misses (previous non-full -> next full).

        One hop only, exactly as written: the arm is consumed by the first
        executed node whatever it resolves to, so later nodes "may use full
        fidelity again" untouched.

        The durable record is produced HERE, engine-side, not in the backend:

        This is the subgraph runner used by ParallelHandler and
        ManagerLoopHandler to execute branches and child subgraphs.

        support#379 (fix 1): this method emits pipeline:node_start /
        pipeline:node_complete for each node it executes — previously it
        emitted nothing at all, leaving ManagerLoopHandler's in-graph
        subgraph path (and any other direct caller) entirely dark.

        Live evidence: run 33337401367 sat 89 minutes past a 19800s fuse
        inside one author node because the fuse (Step 0 above) only ever
        fired BETWEEN nodes; only the CI job's own ``timeout-minutes: 360``
        eventually killed the process, 20+ minutes over its own ceiling,
        leaving checkpoint.json at ``run_state: in_flight`` with no honest
        classification. This path closes that gap in-process.

        The failing outcome carries the EXACT SAME message/failure_reason as
        the pre-existing between-node fuse check
        (``max_pipeline_duration_exceeded`` / "exceeded max duration") --
        the lane workflows' classify step greps that literal string, and it
        must never diverge by call site.

        The interrupted node is recorded HONESTLY: a per-node status.json is
        written showing it was cut off by the fuse, but it is deliberately
        NOT added to ``completed_nodes`` / ``node_outcomes`` -- it never
        completed, so a resume must re-execute it fresh rather than being
        told it finished. No new checkpoint is written here: the on-disk
        checkpoint.json already reflects the last node that genuinely
        completed (or does not exist yet, if this is the very first node),
        which is the correct resume point. ``run()``/``resume()`` flip that
        checkpoint's ``run_state`` to ``completed`` unconditionally once this
        method's Outcome propagates back up through ``_run_loop`` -- so the
        checkpoint is never left ``in_flight`` even though the engine (unlike
        the external-hard-kill path this replaces) was the one that noticed
        its own ceiling and terminated itself.

        Decision (scope, stated rather than silently expanded): this exits
        directly, exactly like the pre-existing between-node fuse path --
        it does NOT route through any recovery/postmortem machinery. The
        known gap ("fuse exit bypasses the recover wall") is unchanged by
        this fix; closing it is out of scope here.
