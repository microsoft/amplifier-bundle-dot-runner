"""``must_write=`` fail-closed artifact contract (EXTENSIONS.md §27).

A node may declare ``must_write=<path>``: completing normally then requires a
fresh, non-trivial artifact at ``<path>``.  The check runs in two places:

1. **Per-attempt, inside the retry ladder** (``retry.execute_with_retry``): a
   completed attempt (SUCCESS / PARTIAL_SUCCESS) that violates the contract
   consumes a retry attempt exactly like a RETRY outcome — the same shape as
   the fail-closed goal-gate verdict retries (EXTENSIONS.md §25).  A no-write
   completion is precisely the flaky-failure class where an in-place retry
   helps: re-invoking the handler gives it another chance to produce the
   artifact.
2. **As the engine's final backstop, after all outcome overrides**
   (``PipelineEngine._check_must_write`` call site): the check runs AFTER
   ``auto_status`` promotion and the ``continue_on_fail`` override, so no
   override can convert a contract violation into a silent success.  This is
   the non-overridable, fail-closed guarantee.

Shared here so both ``engine`` and ``retry`` can use it without a circular
import (``engine`` imports ``retry``).

    """Artifact contract check for the ``must_write=`` attribute (EXTENSIONS.md §27).

    If the node declares ``must_write=<path>`` and ``outcome`` is a completed
    result (SUCCESS / PARTIAL_SUCCESS) produced without a fresh, non-trivial
    artifact at ``<path>``, this returns a FAIL ``Outcome`` that overrides the
    handler's result.  Nodes without ``must_write=`` are completely untouched.
    FAIL outcomes pass through (no double-wrapping); SKIPPED outcomes pass
    through because the node did not execute — the contract applies only to
    completed executions (EXTENSIONS.md §27).

    **Freshness floor (REQUIRED):** the artifact's mtime must be strictly
    greater than ``node_start_wall`` (a ``time.time()`` wall-clock snapshot
    taken immediately before the node's first attempt ran).  A pre-planted
    file whose mtime predates OR equals the node start time FAILS even if it
    has content.  The equality case is rejected explicitly: an adversary (or a
    coarse-resolution filesystem) could set an artifact's mtime via
    ``os.utime`` to match the recorded start time, bypassing a ``>=`` check.
    Strictly-greater-than closes that boundary.

    That strictly-greater-than is evaluated by ``freshness.py``, which
    lowers the floor by the resolution the artifact's own mtime evidences
    (0.0 on a fine-grained filesystem — the comparison is then unchanged,
    equality rejection included; up to 1s on a whole-second filesystem,
    where a legitimately-written artifact would otherwise be stamped
    *before* ``node_start_wall`` and fail this contract having done nothing
    wrong).  See ``freshness.py`` for the exact bound and its cost.

    **Non-trivial:** the artifact must contain at least one non-whitespace
    byte.  An empty file or a whitespace-only file does not satisfy the
    contract.

    **Path resolution:** the path is interpreted as-is when absolute.
    Relative paths are resolved against ``context.target_dir`` if set,
    falling back to ``os.getcwd()``.  This mirrors the ``requires=``
    convention (see ``PipelineEngine._check_requires``).  Document the
    resolution base in the graph's comments or pipeline invocation so
    consumers know which cwd is the anchor.

    **Interaction with retries / goal_gate / continue_on_fail:**
    - A violation on a completed attempt consumes ``max_retries`` attempts
      in-place (see ``retry.execute_with_retry``); when attempts are
      exhausted, the FAIL routes through the node's failure edges
      (``retry_target``, ``condition="outcome=fail"`` edges, etc.) exactly
      like any other FAIL.  ``allow_partial`` does not soften it.
    - ``is_explicit`` is ``False``: the node never asserted a verdict; the
      engine is forcing a FAIL.  A goal_gate=true node whose must_write
      check fires cannot satisfy its own gate (correct — it produced no
      artifact).
    - ``continue_on_fail=true`` cannot suppress the FAIL: the engine's final
      check runs after the override.

    **Residual (delayed-replant window):** mtime-after-start alone leaves
    a narrow window where an external process writes a content-bearing file
    after node start but before the check runs, and the node's own session
    never wrote.  Session attribution (correlating the write to this node's
    session via ``session_id``) is the preferred closing mechanism but is
    not yet implemented; this residual is documented honestly in the
    EXTENSIONS.md entry.

    Returns:
        A FAIL ``Outcome`` if the contract is violated, ``None`` if the
        contract is satisfied or the node has no ``must_write=`` attribute.
