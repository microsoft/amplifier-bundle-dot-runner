"""Checkpointing for pipeline execution — write side and resume load side.

After every node execution, the engine saves a JSON checkpoint so the
pipeline can recover from crashes. The checkpoint captures the current
node, completed nodes (as a list), context snapshot, retry counters,
and execution logs.

**Is the checkpoint a resume marker?**  Yes — but only through the explicit
resume entry point (``attractor resume`` / ``resume_pipeline()`` /
``PipelineEngine.resume()``), which reads it via
:func:`load_checkpoint_for_resume`.  A fresh ``PipelineEngine.run()`` never
reads a checkpoint back: there is no call path from ``run()`` to any loader in
this module, so a stale or foreign ``checkpoint.json`` sitting where a fresh
run can see it is inert to that run *by construction*, not by a guard that
could misfire.  (An identity guard evaluated implicitly on every start is
exactly what made the pre-#66 implementation poison fresh runs.)

Graph-level idempotency (checking STATE.yaml, skipping completed work — see
``examples/pipelines/12-graph-resume.dot``) remains an independent, fully
supported pattern owned by individual node handlers.  Engine resume and
graph-owned skip-through coexist; neither disables the other.

Schema v2 (spec §5.3 superset):
    The six §5.3 fields keep their exact names and shapes
    (``current_node``, ``completed_nodes``, ``context``, ``timestamp``,
    ``node_retries``, ``logs``) at the §5.6 location
    ``{logs_root}/checkpoint.json``.  v2 adds ``schema_version``,
    ``run_state``, ``node_outcomes``, ``engine_state`` and ``graph``
    (fingerprint + embedded DOT source + the optional ``source_dir`` that
    source was read from) so that a resume is self-contained and restores
    state rather than replaying completed work.  ``source_dir`` is provenance
    only -- it anchors relative ``dot_file=`` children on resume and is NOT
    part of the fingerprint, so its arrival did not require a version bump and
    every existing v2 checkpoint stays resumable.
