# Attractor Extensions

Documented divergences and additions relative to the canonical attractor nlspec at
[github.com/strongdm/attractor](https://github.com/strongdm/attractor). The current
canonical snapshot lives at `specs/canonical/attractor-spec-canonical.md`.

**All extensions are backward-compatible with the canonical spec — community `.dot` files
written against the canonical spec should continue to work without modification.**

When in doubt about whether a behavior is spec-conformant, consult the canonical snapshot
before assuming it is a bug.

An extension motivated by a recipe-shaped or other non-attractor consumer meets this
identical bar — see the Compatibility doctrine's rule 5 ("Anchoring survives scope") in
`SPEC_CONFORMANCE.md`.

## Entry Format

Every entry below carries (or, for older entries, has been backfilled with) two mandatory
fields declared in the entry's banner blockquote (or immediately under the heading, for an
entry with no banner):

- **`depends-on: §NN`** (or `depends-on: none`) — the section number of any other entry in
  this file that the current one builds on. This file is a flat chronological list with no
  built-in dependency tracking; `depends-on` makes a stacked extension traceable to its base
  so a reader (or a future author) can see at a glance that entry N assumes entry M's
  behavior. An extension that depends on another entry which is itself an undecided or
  deferred divergence must say so here — don't let a later extension quietly stack on top of
  an open question for months without anyone noticing.
- **`upstream action:`** — **required whenever the entry's banner states the behavior
  DIVERGES from canonical spec** (not required for pure additions to spec-silent areas).
  The value must be one of:
  - a real link to the upstream PR or issue proposing the change at
    `strongdm/attractor` (e.g. `https://github.com/strongdm/attractor/pull/NN` or
    `.../issues/NN`), or
  - `deferred, reason: <one-line reason>, review-by: <YYYY-MM-DD>` — a concrete calendar
    date the deferral will be revisited, not a placeholder, or
  - `declining, reason: <one-line reason>` — an honest statement that no upstream filing
    is planned, because the evidence says one would not land (e.g. the upstream repo is
    dormant, has issues disabled, or its own open community PRs of this kind sit unmerged).
    Declining does not mean the divergence goes unrecorded: it stays exactly here, in this
    ledger, which is what actually informs consumers of this engine. Unlike `deferred`,
    `declining` carries no `review-by` date because there is no pending action to revisit
    on a calendar — only new upstream conditions (the repo becoming active again, issues
    reopening, a maintained fork appearing) would warrant reopening the entry.

  **A non-date value for `review-by` ("eventually", "TBD", "soon", "when we get to it") is
  not a permitted value.** Prose promising an upstream proposal with no date and no link is
  how a divergence sits unreviewed for months; a date makes it someone's job on a specific
  day. When a `review-by` date passes without the proposal being filed, the entry must be
  revisited: either file it, replace the date with a fresh one and a fresh reason, or — if
  the honest conclusion is that filing was never going to land — switch to `declining`.

An entry may additionally carry a **`status:` ABSORBED UPSTREAM @ `<sha>`** banner recording that
the canonical spec has since adopted that entry's behavior item-for-item — from that point the
cited canonical section is the normative text, `upstream action:` no longer applies (there is
nothing left to propose), and the entry body below the banner is retained verbatim purely for
numbering contiguity and history rather than as an independent specification.

---

## 1. BareValue Grammar Production

> **status:** ABSORBED UPSTREAM @ `fb57a55` — canonical spec §2.2 (attractor-spec-canonical.md:99, :106) now specifies this behavior. The canonical snapshot is the normative text; this entry is retained verbatim for numbering/history.

**What:** The value grammar accepts unquoted bare identifiers in addition to quoted strings.
Examples: `shape=box`, `rankdir=LR`, `node_type=llm`. The grammar production is:

```
BareValue ::= [A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_.:-]*
```

**Why:** Graphviz DOT source uses bare identifiers pervasively for built-in shape and
direction attributes. Requiring quotes everywhere would break existing community `.dot`
files. This is an additive clarification of what Graphviz already accepts; it is not a
departure from spec intent.

**Compatibility:** Fully backward-compatible. Quoted values continue to work unchanged.

---

## 2. `default_max_retries` (with Legacy Alias `default_max_retry`)

> **status:** ABSORBED UPSTREAM @ `fb57a55` — canonical spec §2.5 (attractor-spec-canonical.md:139) now specifies this behavior. The canonical snapshot is the normative text; this entry is retained verbatim for numbering/history.

**What:** The graph-level retry ceiling attribute is `default_max_retries` (plural). The
singular `default_max_retry` is accepted as a legacy alias and maps to the same behavior.
Default value is `0` (no retries unless explicitly configured).

**Why:** The plural form is grammatically clearer ("the number of retries" rather than "the
maximum retry"). The legacy alias ensures any existing `.dot` files using the original
singular name continue to work without modification.

**Compatibility:** Both names are valid. Prefer `default_max_retries` in new pipelines.

---

## 3. `max_retries` Node Attribute Inherits Graph-Level Default

> **status:** ABSORBED UPSTREAM @ `fb57a55` — canonical spec §2.6 (attractor-spec-canonical.md:152) now specifies this behavior. The canonical snapshot is the normative text; this entry is retained verbatim for numbering/history.

**What:** When a node omits the `max_retries` attribute, it inherits the graph's
`default_max_retries` value rather than defaulting to `0` independently. This allows a
single graph-level setting to establish a retry policy for all nodes simultaneously.

**Why:** Without inheritance, authors must repeat `max_retries=N` on every node that
should participate in a retry policy. The inheritance behavior is the natural complement to
`default_max_retries` existing at all: a graph-level default that nothing inherits would
serve no purpose.

**Compatibility:** Only observable in pipelines that set `default_max_retries` at the
graph level. Pipelines that do not set it see no change (effective retries remain 0).

---

## 4. `goal_gate` Accepts `PARTIAL_SUCCESS`

> **status:** ABSORBED UPSTREAM @ `fb57a55` — canonical spec §2.6 + §3.4 (attractor-spec-canonical.md:153, :466, :475) now specifies this behavior. The canonical snapshot is the normative text; this entry is retained verbatim for numbering/history.

**What:** A node marked `goal_gate=true` is considered satisfied by either `SUCCESS` or
`PARTIAL_SUCCESS` outcome status. It is NOT satisfied by `FAIL`, `SKIP`, or other
statuses, and the pipeline exits with an unsatisfied-goal error if the node does not
reach at least `PARTIAL_SUCCESS`.

**Why:** Rigid `SUCCESS`-only gate semantics are too coarse for pipelines that implement
best-effort or iterative workflows — for example, a test-generation node that passes most
cases but flags a few as needing human review. Accepting `PARTIAL_SUCCESS` preserves the
gate intent (the node ran and made meaningful progress) while not blocking pipelines that
legitimately reach a partial outcome.

**Compatibility:** Existing `goal_gate=true` nodes that return `SUCCESS` are unaffected.
Nodes that return `PARTIAL_SUCCESS` now satisfy the gate where they previously would have
caused a pipeline failure.

---

## 5. Explicit TRANSFORM Phase in Execution Lifecycle

> **status:** ABSORBED UPSTREAM @ `fb57a55` — canonical spec §3.1 (attractor-spec-canonical.md:320-326) now specifies this behavior. The canonical snapshot is the normative text; this entry is retained verbatim for numbering/history.

**What:** The execution lifecycle includes six phases rather than five:

```
PARSE -> TRANSFORM -> VALIDATE -> INITIALIZE -> EXECUTE -> FINALIZE
```

The TRANSFORM phase applies parse-time transforms (stylesheet resolution, variable
expansion, and custom AST transforms) before validation runs.

**Why:** Placing transforms before validation ensures that validation sees the final,
expanded graph — not the template form with unexpanded variables or unresolved stylesheets.
This prevents spurious validation failures on legal pipeline patterns that are valid only
after expansion.

**Compatibility:** Pipeline authors who consume the execution lifecycle events or hook into
the lifecycle will see a new `TRANSFORM` phase event before `VALIDATE`. Pipelines that do
not hook into lifecycle events are unaffected.

---

## 6. Error Semantics: `RETURN Outcome(status=FAIL)` vs `RAISE`

> **status:** ABSORBED UPSTREAM @ `fb57a55` — canonical spec §4.5 (attractor-spec-canonical.md:686-687; corroborated at §3.5 :502 and §3.2 :391-392) now specifies this behavior. The canonical snapshot is the normative text; this entry is retained verbatim for numbering/history.

**What:** Handler error paths use `RETURN Outcome(status=FAIL, ...)` rather than raising
exceptions. Unhandled exceptions in handler code are caught and wrapped into a `FAIL`
outcome with the exception message in `notes`.

**Why:** Exception propagation from a handler would terminate the entire pipeline rather
than routing through the graph's conditional edges. Returning a `FAIL` outcome preserves
the pipeline's ability to dispatch to a failure branch (e.g., a `condition="outcome=fail"`
edge to a recovery node or human gate). This is the behavior authors expect: a failed node
should trigger failure-path routing, not crash the pipeline.

**Compatibility:** This is an implementation detail of the engine. Pipeline authors observe
`FAIL` outcomes on handler errors regardless of whether the internal mechanism uses
exceptions or return values. Existing pipelines are unaffected.

---

## 7. `type` vs `node_type` Internal Naming

> **status:** ABSORBED UPSTREAM @ `fb57a55` — canonical spec §2.6 (attractor-spec-canonical.md:166) now specifies this behavior. The canonical snapshot is the normative text; this entry is retained verbatim for numbering/history.

**What:** The externally visible DOT attribute name for the node handler type is `type`.
The engine may use an internal field named `node_type` to avoid reserved-word conflicts in
Python (where `type` is a built-in). Both names refer to the same concept; the external
behavior is identical.

**Why:** Python's `type` built-in creates naming conflicts in dataclasses and attribute
access. Using `node_type` internally avoids shadowing the built-in. The DOT attribute name
`type` remains canonical and externally visible.

**Compatibility:** Pipeline authors use `type=llm`, `type=parallel`, etc. in DOT source.
The internal renaming is invisible at the DOT level.

---

## 8. Per-Branch Session Isolation for Full-Fidelity Threading

**What:** Our implementation realizes the spec's §5.4 `full`-fidelity "reused session / same
thread" behavior via an internal `_session_pool` on the backend \u2014 an implementation construct
below the spec's `CodergenBackend` `run(node, prompt, context)` interface (the spec models no
session object). As of this change, when a node executes inside a **parallel branch**, its
session pool and completion-tracking state are **isolated per branch**: each branch runs on a
branch-scoped engine with a cloned backend. Concurrent branches no longer share session state.

**Why:** §3.8 mandates that "each parallel branch receives an isolated clone of the context."
Our `_session_pool` sits below the spec's abstraction, so the spec does not explicitly govern
it \u2014 but sharing it across concurrent branches violated the spec's isolation *intent* and our
own §4.12 handler-statelessness rule, producing silent non-deterministic cross-branch
contamination under `fidelity=full`. Per-branch isolation extends the spec's isolation intent
down to our session-pool layer.

**Compatibility:** Fully backward-compatible. Sequential pipelines and parallel pipelines
without nested stateful codegen see no change. No spec-conformant `.dot` file can depend on
cross-branch session sharing, because the spec never defines that behavior \u2014 it defines the
opposite (§3.8 isolation). This change moves observable behavior toward what a conforming
pipeline already assumes.

> **Implementation note:** `_session_pool` was superseded by `_thread_transcripts` (see §12–13); the per-branch isolation semantics described here remain in effect.

---

## 9. Same `thread_id` Across Concurrent Branches Resolves to Isolation

**What:** The spec contains an unresolved interaction: §5.4 thread-resolution says nodes
sharing a `thread_id` "reuse the same LLM session," while §3.8 says parallel branches must be
isolated. When the **same explicit `thread_id` appears on nodes in two different concurrent
parallel branches**, these two rules conflict. Our implementation resolves this by giving
**§3.8 (branch isolation) precedence**: each branch's nodes get an isolated session even if
they carry an identical `thread_id` to a sibling branch's nodes. Thread-id-based session reuse
continues to work normally for the **sequential** case (nodes in the same linear path).

**Why:** §3.8's isolation mandate is the stronger, more consistent guarantee; a shared LLM
session across concurrent branches is precisely the contamination this change eliminates.
"Isolate by default" is the safe, deterministic resolution of a spec self-contradiction.

**Compatibility:** Backward-compatible for all spec-conformant pipelines except the narrow,
spec-self-contradictory case of an author deliberately placing the same `thread_id` on nodes
in different concurrent branches expecting them to share one session \u2014 a behavior the spec
never coherently defines. Such a pipeline relies on undefined/contradictory behavior; we make
the resolution explicit and deterministic here.

---

## 10. `shape=folder` / `dot_file=` Sub-Pipeline Nodes

**What:** We support a sub-pipeline node declared via `shape=folder` with a `dot_file=`
attribute, which runs an entire child `.dot` graph as a single node's execution. The spec
describes sub-pipeline composition as a *pattern* (§9.4 \u2014 "a node whose handler runs an entire
sub-graph as its execution," with the manager loop named as the example) but does not define a
dedicated `shape=folder` shape or `dot_file=` attribute for it.

**Why:** A first-class folder/sub-pipeline node is ergonomic for composing pipelines from
reusable `.dot` fragments without the manager-loop supervisor machinery. It implements the
spec's §9.4 sub-pipeline pattern with a dedicated, declarative shape.

**Compatibility:** Additive and non-shadowing. `folder` is not a spec-assigned shape in the
§2.8 shape\u2192handler table, and `dot_file` does not collide with any spec-defined attribute
name, so the mechanism cannot change the behavior of any spec-conformant `.dot` file.
(Documenting a pre-existing extension that was previously undocumented.)

**`dot_file=` path resolution:** A relative `dot_file=` value is resolved by
`resolve_dot_path()` (`handlers/pipeline.py`) against a **precedence chain**, not a search
path -- the first non-empty candidate wins, with no existence check:

1. **Absolute path** -- used as-is.
2. **`graph.source_dir`** -- the directory of the `.dot` file that produced the *current*
   graph (root or child).
3. **`context.target_dir`** -- the pipeline's working directory (`--cwd` on the standalone
   CLI; the mounted orchestrator has no equivalent and skips this tier).
4. **`os.getcwd()`** -- the process's current working directory, as a last resort.

Every **child** graph reached through a `shape=folder` node already gets its `source_dir`
set to its own `.dot` file's directory (`PipelineHandler.execute()`, step 5), so a
grandchild's relative `dot_file=` resolves beside the child regardless of where the root
came from. A **root** graph gets its `source_dir` seeded from the directory of the `.dot`
file passed to the entry point that invoked it -- the standalone CLI (`attractor run
<file>`), the mounted `PipelineOrchestrator` (a local `dot_file` in its config), and the
`run_pipeline` tool (a `dot_file` input, forwarded to the mounted orchestrator's spawned
child session as an explicit `source_dir` alongside the already-resolved DOT text) all seed
it this way. Only an **inline** DOT source (`--dot-source`, a `dot_source` config value, or
a `dot_source` tool input) has no backing file and therefore no directory to seed --
`source_dir` stays empty for that root.

**`context.target_dir` (`--cwd`) is an independent knob and does not shadow `source_dir`.**
It answers a different question -- where box/tool nodes write files and read relative
inputs at *runtime* -- while `source_dir` answers where the pipeline's own `.dot` tree lives
on disk. The precedence chain above means an explicitly-set `graph.source_dir` always wins
over `context.target_dir` for `dot_file=` resolution: pointing `--cwd` at a separate
workspace does not require flattening a multi-file pipeline into that workspace.

*Addendum (2026-08-18, issue #200): an unresolvable child `dot_file=` is now its own
**terminal failure class at NODE ENTRY**, and the resolution diagnostic names **every** tier
of the chain above -- not only the tier that won.*

**What did not change (the load-bearing part).** Resolution stays **LAZY**. There is still no
existence check in `resolve_dot_path()`, and still none in `validate()` /
`validate_or_raise()`: a `dot_file=` target that does not exist at parse or admission time is
a **supported shape**. That laziness is what makes **write-then-run composition** possible --
a node writes a child `.dot` during the run and a later `shape=folder` node executes it --
which `examples/objective/objective-runner.dot`'s `compose` path does today
(`docs/designs/2026-08-15-objective-layer.md` §2 P1 / §2.6 finding F2). An admission-time
existence gate would make that graph, and any composition layer, unable to start at all. It
was considered and deliberately **rejected**.

**What changed.** The old behaviour returned `Outcome(FAIL, "Child DOT file not found: X")`
from `PipelineHandler.execute()` step 3. A FAIL outcome goes to edge selection, where FAIL is
fail-fast (§16, no plain-edge drift), so a parent graph with no failure edge terminated
through the §33 no-matching-edge hard fail:

```
[PIPELINE] ✗ Error at child (no_matching_edge): Child DOT file not found: /tmp/…/missing-child.dot
attractor: notes:
No matching edge from node 'child'
```

That framing named the wrong subsystem -- there was no routing problem -- and printed only
the single chosen path, so "resolved against the wrong base directory" had to be inferred.

The handler now asserts existence at **node entry** and raises `ChildDotResolutionError`
(`handlers/pipeline.py`), a distinct class carrying the node id, the literal `dot_file=`
value (plus its `$variable`-expanded form when they differ), and each of the four tiers above
with its would-be path, whether that path exists, and whether it was chosen or skipped
because an earlier tier won. When a lower-precedence tier *does* hold the file, the message
says so outright. `execute_with_retry()` re-raises it rather than flattening it into a FAIL
outcome (retrying cannot create the file); `PipelineEngine.run()` catches it before Step 5
and terminates with `error_type="child_dot_resolution"`, and `run_subgraph()` preserves the
same diagnostic verbatim for folder nodes reached through a parallel branch or the
manager-loop in-graph path.

**Deliberately terminal.** There is no child graph to run and no honest way to route around
one that does not exist, so this fault does not participate in §3.7 per-node failure routing.
Folder-node failure routing itself is untouched: a child that *runs* and fails still
propagates FAIL verbatim and still takes an `outcome=fail` edge or a `retry_target`
(`test_folder_node_failure_routing.py`). Only the "there is no child" case is terminal.

**Advisory lint sibling.** `attractor lint` gained **TOPO-010** (`WARNING`, lint-only) for a
*static relative* `dot_file=` target absent at lint time -- see §32's catalog. It is advisory
because the linter cannot distinguish an author's typo from a child an upstream node writes
mid-run, and it skips absolute targets, `$variable` targets, and graphs with no `source_dir`.
It never fails the exit code and never blocks a composition graph.

**Known residual (named, not silently absorbed):** the manager-loop child dotfile path
(`handlers/manager_loop.py`, `shape=house` / `stack.manager_loop`, marked experimental in the
shape table) still returns `Outcome(FAIL, "Child DOT file not found: …")` and is unchanged
here. It shares `resolve_dot_path()` but not the folder node's execution branch or its
routing semantics; converting it is a separate behaviour change with its own compat surface,
and issue #200's repro does not cover it.

---

## 11. Sub-Pipeline and Manager-Child Execution Is a Fresh Session Boundary

**What:** Same-`thread_id` LLM session continuity (§5.4 thread resolution) applies WITHIN a
single graph traversal. It does NOT cross a sub-pipeline boundary: a node inside a
`shape=folder` / `dot_file=` sub-pipeline (§9.4) or a manager-loop child dotfile (§4.11) runs
as a separate child graph/engine and starts a fresh LLM session, even if it carries the same
`thread_id` as a node in the parent graph. Session continuity for a shared `thread_id` holds
for inline nodes and flattened DOT `subgraph cluster_*` blocks (which §11.1 flattens into the
same graph), but not across a child-graph execution boundary.

**Why:** The spec frames sessions as run-local and non-serializable (§5.3: "in-memory LLM
sessions cannot be serialized"; §3.1 finalize closes sessions), the thread-resolution ladder
is graph-scoped (§5.4, tier 3 is "graph-level default thread"), and §9.4 defines a
sub-pipeline as "a node whose handler runs an entire sub-graph as its execution" — a separate
execution unit. This matches the subagent model (coding-agent-loop §7.1: a child session "runs
its own agentic loop with its own conversation history but shares the parent's execution
environment"). Our implementation makes this concrete: a sub-pipeline / manager child runs on
a child engine with its own session pool. The spec does not explicitly state cross-sub-pipeline
continuity either way; we adopt "fresh boundary" as the deterministic, spec-intent-aligned
choice, consistent with the per-branch isolation decisions in sections 8 and 9.

**Compatibility:** Backward-compatible. No spec-conformant `.dot` can depend on
cross-sub-pipeline session continuity, because the spec never promises it and the surrounding
normative clauses (§5.3, §5.4, §9.4) indicate the opposite. Authors who need a node to continue
a shared-`thread_id` session must keep it inline in the same graph (or in a flattened cluster),
not behind a sub-pipeline / folder / manager-child boundary.

---

## 12. `fidelity=full` Continuity Is Realized via `parent_messages` at Node-Exchange Granularity

**What:** The spec's §5.4 `full`-fidelity "reuse the same session / full history preserved"
requirement is realized in our implementation by a backend-held message-list carrier injected
into each subsequent same-thread spawn via the `parent_messages` mechanism (foundation
`_prepared.py` §4.5 leave-open). The carrier holds **node-exchange granularity**: one
`(role=user, content=instruction)` + `(role=assistant, content=final_output)` pair per `full`
node. The child agent's inner tool-loop turns are **not** included — only the conversation
*between* nodes is preserved, not the child's internal reasoning.

*Addendum (2026-08-28, support#498): the "one pair per `full` node" claim above needs
qualification — as originally implemented it held only when the node's `final_output` was
non-empty. Before this addendum, a node whose child ended on a terminal tool call with no
trailing prose (the normal "work → report_outcome → end" turn shape) caused BOTH halves of the
pair to be silently dropped, even when a recoverable outcome existed — erasing that node's
exchange from every later same-thread spawn's `parent_messages`. The corrected rule: the pair is
**always** emitted when the turn produced a recoverable outcome, whether or not `final_output`
is empty. When it is empty, the assistant half is instead a synthesized marker — attributed
tool-event content, never invented prose — naming the terminal verdict the child ended on, in
one of two shapes keyed on §25's `is_explicit` flag: `[report_outcome: ...]` when a real
`report_outcome` call (or other explicit verdict source) produced the outcome, or
`[spawn-completion: ...]` when the outcome was instead inferred from the orchestrator's own
completion status with no `report_outcome` call at all — the `report_outcome` prefix is reserved
for the former so the transcript never asserts a tool call that did not happen. Whether a
recoverable outcome exists, and which of the two shapes it takes, is governed entirely by §35's
Precedence Policy and §25's `is_explicit` contract; this entry does not redefine either.*

**Why:** The spec's §5.4 language ("reuse the same LLM session", "full history preserved") is
written as a *behavior specification*, not a mechanism mandate. The spec separately notes
(§5.3) that sessions are in-memory and non-serializable, and unified-llm §2.6 models the LLM
client as stateless (continuity = caller-passed message list). Our realization of §5.4 using
`parent_messages` is mechanism-not-policy: the spec's §4.5 CodergenBackend interface is
silent on how continuity is achieved, leaving this to the app layer. Node-exchange granularity
(instruction + final output) was accepted as the meaning of `full` at the backend layer — the
spawn result exposes only `output` + `session_id`, not inner tool-loop turns, so inner-turn
fidelity across nodes is architecturally inaccessible at this layer.

**Compatibility:** Additive and non-breaking. Prior behavior (sub_session_id re-pass) was
silently broken — it never preserved history because session_id is an identity/trace token,
not a history pointer. This change restores the spec-mandated behavior. No spec-conformant
`.dot` file can depend on the broken non-continuity.

---

## 13. `thread_id` Is Branch-Local — Same `thread_id` in Sibling Branches Does Not Join Conversations

**What:** `fidelity=full` session continuity (§5.4 thread resolution) is *branch-local*: the
backend's `_thread_transcripts` carrier is reset to `{}` when a backend is cloned for a
parallel branch (`clone()`). Two sibling branches that both carry an explicit `thread_id`
**do not share conversation history** — each branch accumulates its own independent
transcript. Thread-id-based history continuity operates only within a single linear path
(i.e., a single branch's sequential execution).

**Why:** This resolves the same §5.4 vs §3.8 spec conflict addressed in §9 (per-branch
session-pool isolation): §3.8 isolation (each parallel branch receives an independent clone)
takes precedence over §5.4 thread-id-based reuse when the two rules conflict. Isolation is
the deterministic, safe resolution — a shared conversation across concurrent branches is
precisely the cross-contamination the per-branch isolation design eliminates. The transcript
isolation is a natural consequence of the backend clone resetting mutable state.

**Compatibility:** Backward-compatible. The prior implementation was broken for cross-node
continuity regardless of branching, so no existing pipeline could have been relying on
cross-branch conversation sharing. Authors who intend a shared thread to carry history across
nodes must place those nodes in the same sequential path (not in sibling parallel branches).

---

## 14. `allow_partial` Applies on Node Timeout, Not Only Retry Exhaustion

**What:** The canonical spec scopes `allow_partial` (§2.6) to a single trigger: "Accept
PARTIAL_SUCCESS when retries are exhausted instead of failing" (§5.2 retry pseudocode). We
extend it to a second trigger: when a node with `allow_partial` set exceeds its `timeout`
(§2.6), the engine yields `PARTIAL_SUCCESS` instead of `FAIL`. Because `PARTIAL_SUCCESS` is
success-class for routing (§5.2), the graph continues along the timed-out node's unconditional
edge rather than terminating the run. Without `allow_partial`, a timeout still produces `FAIL`
and flows through normal failure routing (§3.7) — unchanged.

**Why:** For iterative loops (a node meant to make incremental progress across many
executions, with progress recorded in context/files), a single slow iteration hitting its
timeout would otherwise tear down the entire run via §3.7 termination. `allow_partial` is the
author's explicit opt-in that an incomplete-but-progressing node is "good enough to proceed" —
the same intent the spec already honors for retry exhaustion and that §4 honors for goal gates.
Applying it on the timeout path extends that intent to the one other place a node can fail to
fully complete. The behavior is gated entirely behind the opt-in attribute; nodes without it
see no change.

**Note on attribute spelling:** This extension also corrects a string-vs-bool defect at the
`allow_partial` call sites. The DOT parser coerces *unquoted* `allow_partial=true` to bool
`True` but leaves *quoted* `allow_partial="true"` as the string `"true"`; the call sites
previously tested `attrs.get("allow_partial") is True`, which never matched the quoted form —
so `allow_partial` was inert for the common quoted spelling on both the retry-exhaustion and
timeout paths. Both call sites now accept bool `True` or the string `"true"`, so both DOT
spellings behave identically (consistent with extension §1, BareValue, where quoted and
unquoted values are equivalent).

**Compatibility:** Fully backward-compatible. Nodes without `allow_partial` are unaffected
(timeout still routes via §3.7). Nodes that set it now continue past a timeout where they
previously terminated the run — moving observable behavior toward the author's stated intent.
No spec-conformant `.dot` file can depend on the prior "single timeout kills the graph despite
`allow_partial`" behavior, since that was the defect this corrects.

---

## 15. `max_pipeline_duration` Graph-Level Wall-Clock Timeout

**What:** A graph-level attribute `max_pipeline_duration` (integer, milliseconds) that is NOT
defined in the upstream attractor nlspec. When set, the engine checks elapsed wall-clock time
before each step, AND bounds each node's own execution by whatever budget remains; if the
elapsed time exceeds `max_pipeline_duration` (between steps) or the remaining budget is
exhausted DURING a node's own execution, the pipeline terminates immediately with `status=FAIL`
and `failure_reason="max_pipeline_duration_exceeded"`.

**Why:** The upstream spec's step-count ceiling (`max_steps`) guards against infinite loops but
does not bound wall-clock time. Long-running nodes (network calls, LLM invocations) can stall
a pipeline for an unbounded duration even within the step ceiling. `max_pipeline_duration`
provides an independent wall-clock safety bound that is orthogonal to step count and useful
for production deployments with SLA requirements.

**Update (2026-08-31, attractor-674 -- node-granularity enforcement):** the check described
below as "before each step" is real but was, before this update, the ONLY enforcement point --
a single node that itself ran unbounded (network hang, spawned-agent stall) could sail straight
past the ceiling with nothing but an EXTERNAL hard kill (e.g. a CI job's own `timeout-minutes`)
to stop it, leaving `checkpoint.json` at `run_state: in_flight` with no honest classification.
Live evidence: run 33337401367 (2026-08-30) sat 89 minutes inside one author node past a 19800s
fuse; only the CI job's `timeout-minutes: 360` eventually killed it, 20+ minutes over its own
ceiling. The engine now ALSO bounds the node's own await by the REMAINING budget at node start
(computed once, at dispatch time -- not re-checked continuously inside the node), so the fuse is
enforced at node granularity, not just between nodes. This is a behavior-surface update to this
same extension, not a new one: the attribute, its name, its milliseconds unit, its
`failure_reason`/message, and the between-step check are all unchanged.

**Behavior:**
- Checked before each step in the main execution loop (Step 0 in the engine's step dispatch) --
  unchanged.
- ALSO bounds the node's own handler execution: at node dispatch, the engine computes the
  remaining budget (`max_pipeline_duration` minus elapsed-so-far) and awaits the node bounded by
  `min(remaining_fuse_budget, node's own timeout=)` when both apply -- the tighter of the two
  governs the await, and its identity governs which outcome fires on expiry (the graph-level
  fuse always wins a tie, since its whole-pipeline termination must never be masked as an
  ordinary per-node `timeout=` the graph could route around).
- On mid-node expiry: the node's task is cancelled, with a bounded grace window
  (`PipelineEngine._FUSE_CANCEL_GRACE_S`, 5s) for its own cancellation cleanup to finish before
  the engine gives up waiting on it and proceeds -- the engine's own forward progress is never
  held hostage to a handler that does not cooperate promptly with cancellation. The interrupted
  node's `status.json` is written HONESTLY (FAIL, same `failure_reason`), but the node is
  deliberately NOT added to `completed_nodes` -- it never finished, so a resume of an earlier
  checkpoint would (correctly) re-execute it fresh. No new checkpoint is written for the
  interrupted node; the on-disk checkpoint already reflects the last node that genuinely
  completed, and `run()`/`resume()` unconditionally flip its `run_state` to `completed` once this
  path's Outcome returns -- never left `in_flight` even though the ENGINE (not an external killer)
  is what noticed the ceiling.
- Measured via `time.monotonic()` (elapsed milliseconds since pipeline start).
- Terminates the pipeline without executing the current step if the limit is exceeded (between
  steps), or without waiting for the current step to finish (mid-node).
- The termination outcome carries `failure_reason="max_pipeline_duration_exceeded"` and a
  human-readable `notes` message showing the configured limit -- IDENTICAL text at both the
  between-step and mid-node call sites (external consumers, including this repo's own lane
  workflow classify steps, grep the literal substring "exceeded max duration").
- **Decision (scope, stated not silently expanded):** mid-node fuse termination exits directly,
  exactly like the pre-existing between-step path -- it does NOT route through any
  recovery/postmortem machinery. The known gap ("fuse exit bypasses the recover wall") is
  unchanged by this update.

**Implementation locations:**
- `engine.py` -- `_run_loop`'s Step 0 (between-step check, unchanged) and Step 2 node dispatch
  (node-granularity bounding, new); `PipelineEngine._await_node_bounded` (bounded-grace
  cancellation helper); `PipelineEngine._terminate_fuse_mid_node` (mid-node termination path)
- `graph.py` -- `max_pipeline_duration: int | None` field on the `Graph` model (milliseconds,
  unchanged)
- `dot_parser.py` -- promotes the DOT graph-block attribute to `graph_fields`, coercing to `int`
  (unchanged)
- Tests: `modules/loop-pipeline/tests/test_fuse_node_granularity.py` (RED-proofed: hangs/overruns
  on the pre-fix engine, terminates near budget on the fix)

**Compatibility:** Additive. Pipelines that do not set `max_pipeline_duration` are unaffected
(the attribute defaults to `None` and both checks are skipped). The attribute name does not
collide with any upstream spec-defined graph attribute. A pipeline that previously relied on a
single node running past `max_pipeline_duration` without being cut off (i.e. depended on the
pre-fix gap) is, by definition, the incident this update closes -- there is no conformant reason
to depend on that gap.

## 16. Fail-Fast Edge Routing with `runs_on` / `continue_on_fail`

**What:** On a node `FAIL` outcome, unconditional out-edges are followed only if the target
node declares `runs_on` ∈ {`always`, `failure`}; otherwise routing stops (fail-fast). The
`continue_on_fail` attribute opts a node out of fail-fast propagation. Canonical §3.3 step 4
selects the highest-weight unconditional edge regardless of outcome status.

**Why:** Fail-fast prevents a failed stage from silently feeding garbage into downstream work.
Cleanup/notification nodes can still run via `runs_on=always|failure`. This is the engine's
"fail loud, don't proceed in a lesser state" stance.

**Compatibility:** Pipelines with no failures behave identically to canonical. Pipelines that
relied on canonical "continue past FAIL on the best unconditional edge" must add
`runs_on=always` (or `continue_on_fail`) to the intended successor.

**Spec-intended alternative (teach this first for new pipelines):** canonical §3.7 Failure
Routing already gives a graph-native way to route around a FAIL without `runs_on=` /
`continue_on_fail=`: add an explicit edge with `condition="outcome=fail"` from the node that may
fail to the desired successor (canonical §3.7 rule 1, "Fail edge" — checked before this
engine's fail-fast gate ever applies). Worked example, no `runs_on=` attribute anywhere:

```dot
build   [shape=box, prompt="..."]
cleanup [shape=box, prompt="Clean up partial build artifacts."]
deploy  [shape=box, prompt="Deploy the build."]

build -> cleanup [condition="outcome=fail", label="fail-fast: explicit route"]
build -> deploy  [label="success: continue"]
```

If `build` fails, the `condition="outcome=fail"` edge is what `select_edge()` matches; if
`build` has no such edge and no `retry_target`/`fallback_retry_target`, the pipeline terminates
on the failure (canonical §3.7 rule 4) — the same fail-fast guarantee `runs_on=`/
`continue_on_fail=` exists to provide, expressed with zero DOT-runner-specific vocabulary.
`runs_on=`/`continue_on_fail=` remains the right tool when a node must run regardless of
*which* upstream node failed (one cleanup/notification node fed by several possible
predecessors) — the explicit-edge pattern above needs one edge per predecessor;
`runs_on=always` needs none.

## 17. Node I/O Contracts: `requires=` / `outputs=` with Skip Propagation

**What:** Nodes may declare `requires=<keys>` and `outputs=<keys>`. A node whose required
inputs are absent (e.g. produced by a skipped/failed upstream node) is itself skipped, emitting
`PIPELINE_NODE_SKIPPED`; a node that completes without producing its declared `outputs` emits
`PIPELINE_NODE_CONTRACT_VIOLATION`. Skips propagate along the dependency chain.

**Why:** Makes data dependencies explicit and turns "ran but produced nothing useful" into a
loud, observable event rather than a silent downstream failure.

**Compatibility:** Additive — nodes that declare neither attribute are unaffected.

**Spec-intended alternative (teach this first for new pipelines):** the same two effects —
skip a node whose inputs never materialized, and surface a node that produced nothing useful —
are reachable with vocabulary the canonical spec already defines: `condition=` clauses over
`context.<key>` (§10.4/10.5) for the "did the upstream data show up" half, and a `shape=tool`
node running a file-existence check for the "did this node's artifact actually land" half.
Worked example, no `requires=`/`outputs=` anywhere:

```dot
extract [shape=box, prompt="Extract the customer record to context key extracted_record."]

check_extracted [shape=tool, tool_command="test -f .ai/extracted_record.json && echo present || echo absent"]

extract -> check_extracted
check_extracted -> summarize [condition="context.tool.last_line=present", label="input landed"]
check_extracted -> skip_note [condition="context.tool.last_line=absent", label="input missing -- explicit skip"]
```

`context.<key>` conditions cover the "requires=" half directly (route only when the expected
context key is actually set); the tool-node file-existence probe above covers the "outputs="
half for a node whose contract is a file artifact rather than a context key. Both compose with
ordinary `condition=` routing, so the skip is visible in the graph itself rather than inferred
from an internal `PIPELINE_NODE_SKIPPED` event.

## 18. Parallel Join Policies Beyond Canonical: `k_of_n` / `quorum` / `error_policy`

**What:** `shape=parallel` fan-out supports join policies beyond canonical `wait_all` /
`first_success`: `k_of_n` (proceed when k branches succeed), `quorum`, and a configurable
`error_policy` governing how branch errors affect the join.

**Why:** Real fan-out workloads need partial-completion semantics (e.g. "best 3 of 5 drafts")
without hand-rolling them in conditions.

**Compatibility:** Additive — default join behavior matches canonical `wait_all`.

> **Note (usage check, 2026-08-14):** upstream **removed** all three of these from the spec at
> `fb57a55` — canonical §4.8's join-policy table now lists only `wait_all` and `first_success`
> (`specs/canonical/attractor-spec-canonical.md:848-851`) and the error-policy table is gone
> entirely; `k_of_n`, `quorum`, and `error_policy` appear nowhere in the canonical snapshot. They
> are therefore pure extensions now rather than a superset of a canonical vocabulary. Shipped-graph
> usage across every `.dot` in this repo (`examples/**`, `.github/capsule-pipeline/**`, module and
> e2e fixtures): **`k_of_n` = 0, `quorum` = 0, `error_policy` = 5** (`examples/pipelines/05-parallel-fan-out.dot:33`,
> `examples/pipelines/10-full-attractor.dot:65`, `examples/pipelines/practical/pr-review.dot:29`,
> `examples/pipelines/practical/feature-build.dot:35`, `examples/pipelines/practical/multi-lens-review.dot:41`).
> `k_of_n` and `quorum` are a **subtraction candidate — no shipped graph uses them**; `error_policy`
> is genuinely in use and is not. No code was removed here; this note records the finding only.

### status: REMOVED (`k_of_n`/`quorum` only) (2026-08-31, maintainer ruling, Lane 1b -- `feat/extensions-walkback-2`)

**Ruling:** the 2026-08-14 usage-check note above already identified `k_of_n`/`quorum` as a clean
subtraction candidate and recorded the finding without acting on it. Continuing this repair
effort's posture (same principle as Sec 23's and Sec 35's REMOVED notes): once a mechanism is a
confirmed zero-usage subtraction candidate, act on the finding instead of re-recording it.
`error_policy` (`fail_fast`/`continue`/`ignore`) is untouched -- it is load-bearing (2026-08-14
found 5 shipped-graph uses; this pass's fresh census below re-confirms real, non-zero usage in
consumer repos too).

**Re-confirmed zero usage (four repos, `.dot` files):** fresh shallow clones of
amplifier-bundle-attractor, amplifier-resolver-dot-graph, and amplifier-resolve, plus this
repo's own tree -- **`k_of_n` = 0, `quorum` = 0** everywhere, unchanged from the 2026-08-14
finding. `error_policy` remains genuinely in use (non-zero hits in amplifier-bundle-attractor's
shipped graphs, consistent with the original 5-use finding in this repo).

**What actually changed:** `handlers/parallel.py`: the `_run_k_of_n()` early-exit runner, the
`join_policy == "k_of_n"` dispatch branch in `ParallelHandler.execute()`, and the `k_of_n`/
`quorum` branches of `_apply_join_policy()` (including the now-unused `math` import) are
deleted. A node declaring `join_policy=k_of_n` or `join_policy=quorum` now falls through to
`_apply_join_policy()`'s existing "unknown policy" branch -- the SAME `wait_all`-equivalent
fallback any other unrecognized `join_policy` value already received; this is not a new
behavior, just the pre-existing fallback claiming two more (unused) input values. `min_success`/
`quorum_fraction` are no longer read anywhere and are ordinary unrecognized node attributes now.
Tests deleted with the behavior: `TestKOfNJoinPolicy`, `TestQuorumJoinPolicy`, and the four
k_of_n/quorum cases in `TestPolicyEdgeCases` (`tests/test_parallel_policies.py`);
`TestKOfNEarlyExit` in full (`tests/test_parallel_early_exit.py`). `error_policy`'s own tests
(`TestFailFastErrorPolicy`, `TestIgnoreErrorPolicy`) and the surviving `wait_all`/`first_success`/
unknown-policy edge case are untouched.

**Conformance matrix:** `specs/conformance/attractor-matrix.yaml` carries no row keyed to this
extension's join policies (Sec 18 is an EXTENSION-disposition mechanism outside the
canonical-spec row schema the matrix indexes; its one `k_of_n`/`quorum` mention is a historical
`notes:` field on row `ATX-M-000` describing the 2026-08-14 upstream-removal discovery, not an
assertion against this repo's code) -- there is no assertion to flip.

## 19. `wait.human` `freeform` Mode and Attachments

**What:** The human-gate node supports a `freeform` response mode (open text, not only
accelerator-key choices) and file attachments alongside the human's response.

**Why:** Review gates often need a paragraph of guidance or a file, not just an approve/reject
keypress.

**Compatibility:** Additive — accelerator-key gates behave as in canonical.

## 20. Tool Node: `parse_json`, `tool_env`, `tool.last_line`

**What:** `shape=tool` nodes support `parse_json` (parse stdout as JSON into context),
`tool_env` (inject env vars for the command), and expose `tool.last_line` as a routing key in
addition to `tool.output`.

**Why:** Tools that emit JSON or a terminal status line are common; routing on `last_line`
avoids brittle full-stdout matching (the canonical "prose-vs-JSON" hazard).

**Compatibility:** Additive — `tool.output` and existing tool routing are unchanged.

## 21. Variable Expansion Beyond `$goal`: `$param` and `${key}`

**What:** Prompt/attribute substitution supports `$param` and `${key}` forms in addition to the
canonical `$goal`, resolving against pipeline context. Substitution remains simple string
replacement, not a templating engine (consistent with canonical §4.5).

**Why:** Pipelines need to thread context values (not just the goal) into prompts without a
full template language.

**Compatibility:** Additive — `$goal` behaves as in canonical; literals without `$`/`${` are
untouched.

## 22. `outcome=` Condition Resolves to `preferred_label` First

**What:** In edge conditions, the `outcome` key resolves to `outcome.preferred_label` when set
(via `report_outcome`), falling back to `outcome.status`. Canonical §10.4 defines `outcome` as
`outcome.status` only, with `preferred_label` as a separate key.

**Why:** Lets a node steer its own routing by emitting a `preferred_label` through
`report_outcome`, which is load-bearing for outcome-driven pipelines.

**Compatibility:** **Not behavior-neutral.** A canonical pipeline matching `outcome=<status>`
still works *unless* a node also sets a `preferred_label`, in which case `outcome=` matches the
label. Pipelines needing strict status matching should branch on the explicit status value.
Tracked as gap `ATX-5` in `SPEC_CONFORMANCE.md`.

## 23. `response_schema` Node Attribute (Structured Output)

> **This extension is NOT in the canonical attractor spec.** Canonical §4.5 explicitly keeps
> output format at the backend layer, outside the DOT pipeline language. This attribute is an
> additive, backward-compatible extension that is safe to ignore by spec-conformant backends
> that do not support it.

**What:** A node may carry a `response_schema` DOT attribute that declares a JSON Schema object
for its LLM response. When set, the pipeline engine passes a `ResponseFormat(type="json_schema",
json_schema=<schema>, strict=True)` to the `unified-llm-client`'s `generate()` call, requesting
provider-native structured output. The raw JSON text returned by the LLM is stored as the node's
output (`outcome.notes`) and the parsed object is also stashed in pipeline context under the node
ID for downstream use.

**Value forms — either of:**

- **Inline JSON object** (trimmed value starts with `{`): the attribute value is parsed directly
  as a JSON object. Example:
  ```dot
  extract [response_schema="{\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"name\":{\"type\":\"string\"}}}"]
  ```
- **File path** (any other value): resolved relative to the `.dot` file's directory (or the
  current working directory if the graph was loaded from an inline string). The file must contain
  a valid JSON object. Example:
  ```dot
  extract [response_schema="schemas/person.json"]
  ```

**Fail-loud:** If the value is neither valid inline JSON nor a readable file containing a valid
JSON object, `apply_transforms()` raises `ValueError` immediately with a clear message — no
silent skip, no proceeding without a resolved schema.

**Provider threading:** The resolved schema is passed as `ResponseFormat(type="json_schema",
json_schema=schema, strict=True)` to `unified_llm.generate()`. Provider mapping is handled by
the `unified-llm-client` library:
- OpenAI: native `response_format` JSON Schema mode.
- Gemini: `response_mime_type="application/json"` + `response_schema`.
- Anthropic: tool-extraction technique (the library synthesizes a `__structured_output__` tool).

**Spawn path limitation:** `response_schema` is **only** supported when the node executes via the
direct-LLM path (`AmplifierBackend` Path B or `DirectProviderBackend`). If a node with
`response_schema` routes through `AmplifierBackend._run_with_spawn` (Path A — full child
session), the engine returns `Outcome(FAIL)` with a clear message:
_"response\_schema is only supported on direct-LLM nodes (not spawned-agent nodes) yet."_

**Downstream:** The structured JSON string is set as `outcome.notes`. The parsed object (when
JSON is valid) is stored in pipeline context as `context[node.id]` for downstream nodes to
reference via `${node_id}` substitution or direct context lookup.

**Compatibility:** Fully additive and backward-compatible. Nodes without `response_schema` are
unaffected. Existing `.dot` files work without modification. Canonical spec-conformant backends
that do not read `response_schema` will silently treat it as an unknown attribute (per the
existing unknown-attr passthrough behaviour of `dot_parser.py::_apply_node`).

### status: REMOVED (2026-08-31, maintainer ruling, Lane 1b -- `feat/extensions-walkback-2`)

**Ruling:** continuing the repair posture Sec 35's own REMOVED note set (same principle, same
repair effort): an extension whose job is already done by a spec-native alternative gets
REMOVED, not carried on a compatibility glide path. The BACK-OUT note above (dated 2026-08-29)
said mechanism removal was "not done in this change and is filed as a follow-up"; this note is
that follow-up. This entry's BODY (the attribute's two value forms, provider threading, the
spawn-path limitation, the fail-loud file/JSON parsing rules) stays put -- the ledger is
append-only and describes what shipped historically -- but none of it is live code any more as
of this note.

**Re-confirmed zero usage (four repos, same method as the 2026-08-29 census):** fresh shallow
clones of amplifier-bundle-attractor, amplifier-resolver-dot-graph, and amplifier-resolve, plus
this repo's own tree, still show **zero shipped `.dot` graphs** declaring `response_schema=`
anywhere. The only first-party Python hits outside this repo's own (now-deleted) test suite are:
(a) amplifier-bundle-attractor's `modules/loop-pipeline/**`, a vendored copy of THIS module, not
an independent consumer; and (b) one test in amplifier-resolve
(`tests/test_mcp_contract.py::test_validate_pipeline_response_schema_is_valid`) that exercises
this engine's own `validate()` path against a raw (pre-transform) `response_schema=` string --
it asserts the ABSENCE of a `response_schema_valid` diagnostic, an assertion that stays
trivially true once the rule no longer exists at all. Neither is a real production dependency;
both are unaffected by this removal.

**What actually changed:**

- `graph.py`: the `Node.response_schema` dataclass field and its entry in
  `_NODE_PROMOTED_ATTRS` are deleted. A `response_schema=` DOT attribute is now an ordinary
  unrecognized node attribute -- silently passed through per `dot_parser.py::_apply_node`'s
  existing unknown-attribute behavior, the same fate every other unlisted DOT attribute already
  gets. This is a deliberate **silent-ignore**, not a new loud-unknown special case: making one
  specific formerly-known attribute name loud while every other unknown attribute stays silent
  would itself be a new, undocumented divergence the engine does not otherwise draw.
- `transforms.py`: `resolve_response_schemas()`, `_resolve_response_schema_value()`, the
  `_RESPONSE_SCHEMA_DEPRECATION_MSG` constant, and the deprecation-warning call site are
  deleted; `apply_transforms()` no longer resolves or warns on this attribute.
- `validation.py`: `_check_response_schema()` (the `response_schema_valid` diagnostic rule) and
  its call site are deleted.
- `backend.py`: the `_run_with_spawn` guard that failed a `response_schema` node routed through
  the spawn path is deleted (a spawned node has no `response_schema` field left to check), and
  `_outcome_from_structured_output()` (the format-vs-verdict `Outcome` builder for schema nodes)
  is deleted outright.
- `workers/direct_worker.py`: the `ResponseFormat`/`response_format` construction, the
  `node.response_schema is not None` dispatch branch, and `_structured_output_result()` are
  deleted. `_structured_output_result()` also carried the Anthropic `__structured_output__`
  tool-call JSON-recovery fix (ATX-9) -- that recovery only ever fired on this schema path, so
  it has no other caller left to serve. Every node now runs the plain `_tool_loop_result()`
  path unconditionally.
- Tests deleted WITH the behavior, never weakened-kept: `tests/test_response_schema.py`,
  `tests/test_response_schema_deprecation_warning.py`, and
  `tests/test_tool_extraction_regression.py` in full -- the last one's entire premise
  (recovering JSON from a synthetic `__structured_output__` tool call) cannot occur once nothing
  ever requests `response_format` any more. `tests/test_fail_closed_outcomes.py` and
  `tests/test_direct_worker_merge.py` only referenced the deleted files in comments; those
  comments are updated, no test bodies changed.
- `SPEC_CONFORMANCE.md` rows ATX-8/ATX-9 are marked REMOVED with a dated addendum pointing here.
  `specs/conformance/attractor-matrix.yaml` carries no row keyed to this extension (Sec 23 is an
  EXTENSION-disposition mechanism outside the canonical-spec row schema the matrix indexes), so
  there is no assertion there to flip.

**Precedence, restated:** the two spec-native channels this attribute always duplicated are now
the whole of the structured-output story for a schema-shaped node: Sec 25's fail-closed
pure-JSON `goal_gate` verdict ladder (`_parse_outcome` against `result.text`), and Sec 41's
`status.json` audit-trail channel. Neither ever depended on `response_schema`, and both remain
unconditionally reachable exactly as before this removal.

**What:** Three coordinated additions that make the attractor convergence claim measurable:

1. **Per-iteration node records** — on each `loop_restart` edge traversal the engine creates
   `logs_root/iteration_N/<node_id>/status.json` alongside the existing flat
   `logs_root/<node_id>/status.json` (backward compat). Each iteration's records are preserved;
   a 10-iteration run yields 10 complete per-iteration snapshots, none overwritten.

2. **`$iteration` / `$loop_count` context keys** — the engine seeds `iteration` and `loop_count`
   into `PipelineContext` at pipeline start (value `"0"`) and increments both on every
   `loop_restart`. Because the substitution machinery (`substitution.py`) already expands `$key`
   from context, `$iteration` and `$loop_count` are immediately usable in `prompt` attributes
   and `tool_command` strings without any additional wiring.

3. **`trace.jsonl` descent curve** — the engine appends one JSONL record to
   `logs_root/trace.jsonl` after every node completion (including skipped nodes). Record shape:
   ```json
   {"iteration": 0, "node_id": "work", "status": "success", "preferred_label": "go",
    "duration_ms": 42.1, "ts": "2024-01-01T00:00:00+00:00"}
   ```
   The file is append-only and engine-written (not hook-derived), so it survives without any
   hook configured. Reading it across all iterations gives the descent curve: gate signals and
   durations per node per iteration.

4. **`attractor trace <run-dir>` CLI subcommand** — reads `trace.jsonl` and prints a
   human-readable summary of iterations, nodes, statuses, and durations. Exits 0 even if no
   `trace.jsonl` exists (run directories that predate this extension).

**Why:** The attractor claim is *convergence*: work descends toward a verified sink. Without
per-iteration records, "converged" and "got lucky once" are indistinguishable. `trace.jsonl` is
the empirical form of the convergence claim — a descent curve that can be plotted, compared
across runs, and used as evidence in evals. `$iteration` lets pipeline authors write prompts
that reference the current iteration number (e.g. "This is attempt $iteration — previous
attempts failed because…").

**Canonical spec note:** The canonical spec should gain matching vocabulary for per-iteration
run directories and a trace artifact in the Appendix C run-directory layout section. Until then,
this extension documents the behavior here.

**Backward compatibility:** Fully additive.
- Existing pipelines that do not use `loop_restart` see no change (iteration stays `"0"` and
  `trace.jsonl` records only that single pass).
- The flat `logs_root/<node_id>/status.json` path is preserved alongside the new
  `iteration_N/<node_id>/status.json` path — existing consumers that read the flat path are
  unaffected.
- `$iteration` and `$loop_count` in context are new keys; existing pipelines that happen to
  use those names as their own context keys will see them overwritten at pipeline start and on
  each `loop_restart`. Pipeline authors should treat `iteration` and `loop_count` as reserved
  context key names going forward.

**Implementation locations:**
- `engine.py: _initialize_context()` — seeds `iteration` and `loop_count` to `"0"` at start
- `engine.py: run() Step 6 (loop_restart)` — increments and re-seeds both keys on restart
- `engine.py: _write_node_status()` — writes iteration-scoped path and appends to `trace.jsonl`
- `modules/pipeline-runner/amplifier_module_pipeline_runner/cli.py: cmd_trace()` — trace subcommand

### Incident motivation

2026-07-28: a 20-node pipeline ran 2.4 hours via the standalone attractor CLI and exited
`status=success` with zero work product. The convergence judge node (marked `goal_gate=true`)
wrote "NOT CONVERGED — 2 of 7 criteria pass. The networking implementation does not work and
the harness was never created." — and was recorded `outcome=success` because `_parse_outcome`'s
final fallback converted the plain-prose response to SUCCESS. The designed replan loop
(`max_retries=4, retry_target=analyze_plan`) never fired. This extension closes that class of
false success.

### What the canonical spec says

Canonical spec §4.5 `CodergenHandler` pseudocode:

```
any string response → write response.md → Outcome(status=SUCCESS, notes="Stage completed: …")
```

This is unconditional: even a response that literally says "NOT CONVERGED" is recorded as
SUCCESS. The spec is fail-open by design (it assumes the node's prose is advisory and routing
is the caller's responsibility).

### What this extension does instead

**Scope decision: goal_gate=true nodes only.** A global default flip to RETRY/FAIL for all
plain-text responses would break nearly every existing pipeline (most `box` nodes in tutorials
and examples end in prose — see backward-compat inventory below). The fail-closed contract
applies only when the node carries `goal_gate=true`, which already signals that the node's
outcome is load-bearing for pipeline exit.

**The verdict-recovery ladder is preserved.** `_parse_outcome` already tries (in order):
1. Fenced JSON (` ```json … ``` `) → strip fence, parse as JSON
2. Pure JSON (`stripped.startswith("{")`) → parse, honor `status` field
3. Embedded verdict recovery → find last balanced `{…}` in prose, parse if it carries `status`

The fail-closed rule sits **below** this ladder. Only when every recovery attempt has failed
(the output is genuinely plain prose with no parseable verdict) does the fail-closed rule fire.
Judges that emit prose + trailing JSON verdicts keep working via path 3.

**Status choice: RETRY, not FAIL.** FAIL is fail-fast — it does not traverse plain edges
(EXTENSIONS.md §16; `edge_selection.py:79-101`). A naive FAIL default would convert observer/
reporter nodes with only plain out-edges into hard stops. RETRY respects `max_retries` (then
degrades to FAIL) and is the appropriate signal for "try again with an explicit verdict." When
`max_retries=0`, RETRY degrades immediately to FAIL at the goal-gate check.

**`is_explicit` field on `Outcome`.** A new `is_explicit: bool` field (default `False`)
distinguishes an asserted verdict from a defaulted one. `is_explicit=True` is set by every
producer with an unambiguous verdict mechanism:

- `report_outcome` tool call (tool-loop, direct-provider, and spawn paths)
- pure JSON / fenced JSON / recovered embedded JSON verdicts (`_parse_outcome`)
- a tool (parallelogram) node's exit code — 0 is an explicit success, nonzero an explicit
  fail (`handlers/tool.py`); the exit code IS the verdict
- **verdict-shaped** `response_schema` structured output — a captured `report_outcome`
  call or a `status` field with a recognized value (see policy decision below)
- deterministic handler verdicts that cannot be LLM-defaulted: human-gate selections and
  freeform input (`handlers/human.py`), structural no-op SUCCESS (`start`/`exit`/
  `conditional` handlers), fan-in ranking (`handlers/fan_in.py`), and parallel join-policy
  aggregation (`handlers/parallel.py`)

`is_explicit=False` marks defaulted statuses: the plain-prose fallback, empty-response
defaults, a spawn wrapper's status-only completion, **non-verdict** structured output
(parseable or not — format is not a verdict), and config/environment failures (timeout,
missing `tool_command`, handler exception) where no verdict was produced.

**Enforcement is two-layer (belt and suspenders).**

1. *Parser layer:* `_parse_outcome` returns RETRY (not SUCCESS) for plain-prose goal_gate
   responses, so retry machinery fires at the node.
2. *Gate layer (centralized):* `_check_goal_gates()` treats a gate as satisfied only when
   `outcome.is_success AND outcome.is_explicit` (`engine.py`). This closes bypass paths that
   never reach the parser's plain-prose rung — notably the spawn path's status-only SUCCESS
   and unparseable structured output.

`is_explicit` is therefore load-bearing at the gate check, not just observability metadata.
Any new Outcome producer must classify itself: set `is_explicit=True` iff the status comes
from an unambiguous verdict mechanism.

**`response_schema` policy decision (corrected in independent review round 2).**
**Format ≠ verdict.** Parseable schema output proves the model followed the requested
FORMAT; it does not prove the node asserted a VERDICT. Schema-parsed output is explicit
ONLY when it carries a recognized verdict, routed through the same verdict ladder as every
other path: a captured `report_outcome` tool call (authoritative), or a `status` field
whose value is a recognized StageStatus. Generic structured output — `{"name": "Alice"}`,
`{"assessment": "NOT CONVERGED"}` — stays DERIVED (`is_explicit=False`): the node still
returns SUCCESS (ordinary schema nodes are unchanged), but a `goal_gate=true` schema node
cannot satisfy its gate with it. The original round-1 policy ("parseable schema output IS
explicit") was a false-success side door: a goal_gate structured-output judge returning
`{"assessment": "NOT CONVERGED"}` — or a name-extraction payload — would have shipped
success. Both structured-output paths (`backend.py` tool-loop and
`DirectProviderBackend.run()`) share one classifier
(`backend._outcome_from_structured_output`); empty or unparseable schema output also
stays `is_explicit=False`, so a goal_gate schema node fails closed in every non-verdict
case.

**CodergenHandler string path.** When a backend returns a raw string (the spec §4.5
`CodergenHandler` path — exercised by simple/custom backends and test doubles), a
`goal_gate=true` node's string is routed through the verdict-recovery ladder
(`_parse_outcome`): JSON verdicts are honored, plain prose returns RETRY. This implements in
our own handler the exact goal_gate check the walk-upstream note recommends for the spec.
Non-goal_gate string responses keep the unconditional-SUCCESS wrap (spec §4.5 preserved).

**Spawn-path consistency.** `_outcome_from_spawn_result()` returns `is_explicit=False` when
recovering from the orchestrator's completion status alone (no `report_outcome`, no JSON). A
goal_gate child that produces no final text and no report_outcome cannot satisfy its gate via
the spawn wrapper's status field alone — the gate layer rejects it.

### Backward-compat inventory

**Producer classification (every Outcome-producing path that can reach a goal-gate check):**

| Producer | Verdict mechanism | `is_explicit` |
|---|---|---|
| `report_outcome` tool call (tool-loop / direct-provider / spawn metadata) | asserted by node | `True` |
| Pure / fenced / embedded JSON verdict (`_parse_outcome`) | asserted by node | `True` |
| Tool node exit code (`handlers/tool.py`) — 0 and nonzero | process exit code | `True` |
| `response_schema` output carrying a verdict — captured `report_outcome`, or `status` field with a recognized value (`backend._outcome_from_structured_output`) | verdict via the standard ladder | `True` |
| `response_schema` output WITHOUT a verdict — generic data such as `{"name": "Alice"}`; also empty/unparseable | format only, no verdict | `False` (gate fails closed) |
| Plain-prose fallback (`_parse_outcome`) | none — defaulted | `False` (+ RETRY for goal_gate) |
| Codergen string-wrap for non-goal_gate nodes (spec §4.5) | none — defaulted | `False` (not gate-relevant) |
| Spawn status-only completion (`_outcome_from_spawn_result`) | wrapper status, not node verdict | `False` (gate fails closed) |
| Empty response (any path) | none | `False` (FAIL) |
| Tool timeout / missing `tool_command` / handler exception | environment failure | `False` (FAIL — not gate-relevant) |
| Human gate selection / freeform input (`handlers/human.py`) | deterministic human action — cannot be LLM-defaulted | `True` |
| Human gate SKIPPED (`handlers/human.py`) | deterministic interviewer decision | `True` (FAIL) |
| Start / Exit / Conditional structural no-ops | deterministic structural SUCCESS — no LLM in the loop | `True` |
| Fan-in ranking verdict (`handlers/fan_in.py`) | deterministic aggregation over branch statuses | `True` |
| Fan-in with no `parallel.results` (`handlers/fan_in.py`) | environment/wiring failure | `False` (FAIL) |
| Parallel join-policy verdict, incl. no-branch SUCCESS (`handlers/parallel.py`) | deterministic counting rule over branch statuses | `True` |
| Parallel branch exception / missing engine (`handlers/parallel.py`) | environment failure | `False` (FAIL) |
| Manager-loop stop/guard completion (`handlers/manager_loop.py`) | the child's verdict | propagates child's `is_explicit` |
| Manager-loop cycle exhaustion / config failure (`handlers/manager_loop.py`) | environment failure | `False` (FAIL) |
| Folder / pipeline (subgraph) node (`handlers/pipeline.py`) | child pipeline's terminal outcome — CAN carry a defaulted LLM completion | propagates child's `is_explicit` (outcome returned verbatim) |

**Shipped examples with `goal_gate=true` nodes (complete sweep of `examples/`):**

| File | Gate node(s) | Behavior delta |
|---|---|---|
| `examples/patterns/task-runner.dot` | `verify`, `verdict` (parallelogram tool gates) | **None** — tool exit codes are explicit verdicts; gates satisfied on exit 0 exactly as before |
| `examples/pipelines/practical/feature-build.dot` | `integration_test` (LLM, retry_target=self) | Plain-prose completion now RETRYs instead of silently satisfying the gate |
| `examples/pipelines/02-plan-implement-test.dot` | `implement` (LLM) | Same — explicit verdict (report_outcome / JSON) now required |
| `examples/pipelines/04-retry-with-fallback.dot` | `implement`, `simple_implement` (LLM) | Same |
| `examples/pipelines/10-full-attractor.dot` | `implement_backend`, `implement_frontend` (LLM) | Same |
| `examples/pipelines/practical/pr-review.dot` | `generate_comments` (LLM, no retry_target) | Same; with no retry_target an unsatisfied gate ends the pipeline FAIL (see hazard note) |
| `examples/pipelines/practical/multi-lens-review.dot` | `synthesize` (LLM, no retry_target) | Same |
| `examples/pipelines/practical/refactor.dot` | `snapshot_tests` (LLM, retry_target=self) | Same |
| `examples/pipelines/practical/test-gen.dot` | `write_tests` (LLM, retry_target) | Same |

For the LLM gate nodes above this is the intended breaking change: in the default Amplifier
backend the child session has the `report_outcome` tool available and is prompted to use it;
completions that end in bare prose now RETRY (then degrade to FAIL) instead of silently
recording success — which is the incident class this extension closes.

**Tests affected and updated in this change:**

| Test | Why affected | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| `test_goal_gate_retry_clears_failures.py` (3 tests, tool-node gates) | tool exits lacked `is_explicit` | fixed by `handlers/tool.py` (exit codes are explicit) |
| `test_pipeline_e2e.py::TestGoalGate::test_success_with_satisfied_gate` | `SuccessBackend` returned plain prose | `SuccessBackend` now returns a pure-JSON verdict |
| `test_pipeline_e2e.py::TestGoalGate::test_retry_on_unsatisfied_gate` | `RetryThenSucceedBackend` Outcome lacked `is_explicit` | double now sets `is_explicit=True` |
| `test_pipeline_e2e.py::TestSpecSmokeTest::test_step3_execute` | `SuccessBackend` plain prose on `goal_gate` node | same `SuccessBackend` fix |
| `tests/test_backend.py:576` `test_backend_plain_text_returns_success` | tests a **non**-goal_gate node | unaffected (plain prose → SUCCESS preserved) |
| `tests/test_backend.py:1096` `test_parse_outcome_plain_text_returns_success` | `_parse_outcome` with no `node` arg | unaffected |
| `tests/test_goal_gates.py` | MockBackend returns explicit Outcomes | updated with `is_explicit=True` on mock verdicts |

**Plain-edge silent-hard-stop hazard:** Observer and reporter nodes that have only plain
out-edges and no `goal_gate=true` are **unaffected** — they still get SUCCESS for plain prose
(spec §4.5 preserved). For `goal_gate=true` nodes with only plain out-edges, the RETRY status
will not traverse those edges (RETRY routes like FAIL for edge selection). Authors should
ensure goal_gate nodes have explicit `condition="outcome=fail"` or `retry_target` edges, or
use `report_outcome` / JSON verdicts to produce the expected routing signal. The lint sweep
(`test_examples_lint_clean.py`) and `dot_graph validate` catch isolated nodes and missing
fallback edges.

### Walk-upstream note

The canonical spec §4.5 default should change to: when a node carries `goal_gate=true`, a
plain-prose response (no JSON, no `report_outcome`) must NOT be recorded as SUCCESS. The
recommended upstream change is to add a `goal_gate` check in `CodergenHandler` before the
final SUCCESS fallback, returning RETRY (or FAIL with a clear message) instead. Until the
upstream spec adopts this, this extension documents the divergence.

### Implementation locations

- `backend.py: _parse_outcome()` — fail-closed rule at the final rung; `node` parameter added
- `backend.py: _outcome_from_spawn_result()` — status-only success is `is_explicit=False`
- `backend.py: _run_with_spawn()` — passes `node=node` to `_parse_outcome`
- `backend.py: _run_with_tool_loop()` — passes `node=node` to `_parse_outcome`; no-text path
  now returns FAIL for goal_gate nodes (consistent with spawn path's empty→FAIL); non-goal_gate
  no-text keeps the spec §4.5 SUCCESS default; structured-output path delegates to
  `_outcome_from_structured_output` (verdict-shaped → explicit; generic data → derived)
- `backend.py: _outcome_from_structured_output()` — the single structured-output classifier
  shared by both backends (format ≠ verdict; see policy decision above)
- `__init__.py: DirectProviderBackend.run()` — passes `node=node` to `_parse_outcome`; same
  no-text scoping; structured-output path delegates to the shared classifier
- `outcome.py: Outcome` — `is_explicit: bool = False` field added
- `handlers/tool.py: ToolHandler.execute()` — exit-code outcomes are explicit verdicts
  (`is_explicit=True` for both exit 0 → SUCCESS and nonzero → FAIL); timeout, missing
  `tool_command`, and handler exceptions remain non-explicit (no verdict was produced)
- `handlers/codergen.py: CodergenHandler.execute()` — goal_gate string responses are routed
  through `_parse_outcome` (verdict ladder + fail-closed); non-goal_gate string responses keep
  the spec §4.5 unconditional-SUCCESS wrap
- `handlers/human.py` — selections, freeform input, and SKIP are explicit (deterministic
  human/interviewer actions); a `goal_gate=true` human gate is satisfiable
- `handlers/start.py`, `handlers/exit.py`, `handlers/conditional.py` — structural no-op
  SUCCESS is explicit (deterministic, no LLM in the loop)
- `handlers/fan_in.py`, `handlers/parallel.py` — aggregation/join-policy verdicts are
  explicit (deterministic rules over branch statuses); wiring/environment failures stay
  non-explicit
- `handlers/manager_loop.py` — stop/guard completions propagate the child's `is_explicit`;
  exhaustion and config failures stay non-explicit
- `handlers/pipeline.py` — returns the child outcome verbatim, so the child's `is_explicit`
  propagates (a folder node's outcome CAN carry a defaulted LLM completion)
- `engine.py: _check_goal_gates()` — centralized gate enforcement:
  `gate_satisfied = outcome.is_success and outcome.is_explicit`. The gate DOES consult
  `is_explicit` directly; this is what closes the spawn status-only bypass and any future
  producer that forgets to classify itself
- `engine.py: _write_node_status()` and `handlers/codergen.py: _write_status()` —
  `is_explicit` is serialized into every `status.json` (flat + iteration-scoped) and every
  `trace.jsonl` record, making it durable audit data rather than an in-memory-only flag

## 26. Worker-Session Observability: Durable `response.md` + Real Session-Event Persistence

> **This extension is additive** — it implements the canonical spec's own run-dir layout
> contract (§5.6 requires per-node `prompt.md`/`response.md`) and adds worker-session event
> persistence the spec does not specify. It also FIXES a spec self-contradiction; see the
> walk-upstream note below.

### Incident motivation

Worker sessions inside a pipeline run were write-only compute: they thought, acted, and
vanished. Three separate post-mortems (one on the 2026-07-28 external incident that also
motivated §25, two on internal runs) all dead-ended on the same missing evidence:

- The node's full final response survived only as a ~200-char scrap
  (`notes="Plain text response: {output[:200]}"` / `last_response[:200]`), because the
  codergen handler wrote `response.md` only when the backend returned a *string* — and the
  production `AmplifierBackend` spawn path always returns an `Outcome`, early-returning past
  the write. Diagnostic analyses produced by pipeline nodes were cut off mid-sentence.
- The `session_id` recorded in `status.json` was a dangling pointer: no `events.jsonl` or
  `transcript.jsonl` existed anywhere on disk for spawned worker sessions (foundation's spawn
  path never persists; see walk-upstream note). "Which tools did the worker call?" — the
  first question of every wrong-but-plausible audit — was unanswerable.

### What this extension does

**1. Full-response durability (`Outcome.response_text` → `response.md`).**
`_parse_outcome()` (backend.py) now carries the verbatim child output on
`Outcome.response_text` — set on every return path, *before* any truncation. The codergen
handler writes it to `<stage_dir>/response.md` on the Outcome path, closing the early-return
gap. The field is a file-write concern only: it is NOT serialized into `status.json`,
`trace.jsonl`, or `context_updates`, and the ≤200-char `last_response` context truncation is
unchanged (context economy working as designed).

**2. `session_id` in the codergen early-writer.** The engine's status writers already
serialize `session_id`; the codergen handler's own `_write_status()` now does too, so the
Outcome path never leaves a status record without its join key.

**3. Real worker-session event persistence.** The worker's actual event stream is captured
and persisted per session:

- `amplifier_module_loop_pipeline.worker_observability` exposes a `ContextVar`
  (`current_worker_sessions_dir`); the codergen handler sets it to `<stage_dir>/sessions`
  for the duration of each backend call (try/finally-reset, task-local so parallel branches
  cannot cross-talk).
- `hooks-pipeline-observability` — already mounted into the parent session by the
  attractor-core behavior, and composed into **every spawned worker session** by
  `PreparedBundle.spawn`'s parent+child bundle composition — registers a
  `SessionEventPersister` that appends each received event to
  `<stage_dir>/sessions/<session_id>/events.jsonl`. The `session_id` comes from the event
  payload itself: the amplifier-core kernel merges it into every event via
  `hooks.set_default_fields` at session construction.
- Persisted events (curated for forensic value; streaming deltas excluded):
  `session:start`, `session:resume`, `session:end`, `prompt:submit`, `prompt:complete`,
  `tool:pre`, `tool:post`, `orchestrator:complete`. Record shape is the standard session
  observer shape — `{"event": <name>, "timestamp": <utc-iso>, "data": {...}}` — one JSON
  object per line, append-only.

These are the events the worker's own orchestrator/kernel emit as they happen (e.g.
loop-agent's `tool:pre`/`tool:post` at tool-execution time) — captured, not reconstructed.
An earlier design that fabricated a 3-event ledger after the child completed was rejected in
review: a synthetic record cannot answer "which tools did the worker call?" and amounts to a
second, invented session store.

### Forensic navigation contract

Starting from ONLY the run dir:

```
<logs_root>/<node_id>/status.json        → read "session_id"
<logs_root>/<node_id>/sessions/<session_id>/events.jsonl
                                         → the worker's real event stream
<logs_root>/<node_id>/response.md        → the worker's full final response
```

### Walk-upstream note: where persistence belongs

Session persistence is a *session* concern owned by amplifier-foundation: ordinary sessions
persist `events.jsonl`/`transcript.jsonl` under `~/.amplifier/projects/<project>/sessions/<id>/`
(`amplifier_foundation/session/store.py`, `finder.py`). On this stack that idiom never fires
for pipeline workers: `PreparedBundle.spawn()` has **zero persist call sites** —
`DEFAULT_SESSIONS_ROOT` is never written for spawned children; they are ephemeral by
construction. The right long-term home for worker persistence is therefore foundation's spawn
path (an upstream change to a different repo). Until that exists, this bundle captures the
real event stream at the seam it owns — the hooks module it already mounts into every worker
session — and persists it in the run dir, which is (a) the canonical pipeline-scoped forensic
record (`prompt.md`, `response.md`, `status.json` already live there) and (b) durable in
CI/sandbox environments where `$HOME` is ephemeral. Standard file name, standard record
shape, real events — pointers stay resolvable without inventing a parallel session store.

**Spec self-contradiction (flagged upstream):** canonical spec §5.6 *requires* per-node
`prompt.md` and `response.md` in the run-dir layout, and its conformance checklist asserts
`artifacts_exist(logs_root, <node>, ["prompt.md", "response.md", "status.json"])` — yet the
spec's own CodergenHandler pseudocode contains an
`IF result is an Outcome: write_status(stage_dir, result); RETURN result` early-return that
skips the `response.md` write for Outcome-returning backends. The shipped handler had
faithfully transcribed that self-contradiction. This extension implements the layout
contract; the spec's pseudocode should be corrected to match its own §5.6.

### Files touched

- `modules/loop-pipeline/amplifier_module_loop_pipeline/outcome.py` — `response_text` field
- `modules/loop-pipeline/amplifier_module_loop_pipeline/backend.py` — `_parse_outcome()`
  sets `response_text` on all return paths
- `modules/loop-pipeline/amplifier_module_loop_pipeline/worker_observability.py` — the
  ContextVar seam (new)
- `modules/loop-pipeline/amplifier_module_loop_pipeline/handlers/codergen.py` — Outcome-path
  `response.md` write, ContextVar set/reset, `session_id` in `_write_status()`
- `modules/hooks-pipeline-observability/amplifier_module_hooks_pipeline_observability/session_events.py`
  — `SessionEventPersister` (new), registered in the module's `mount()`

### Compatibility

Fully backward-compatible and fail-safe:

- Existing pipelines run unchanged; `last_response` truncation and spawn/continuity semantics
  (thread transcripts, CR-1 invariant) are untouched.
- Persistence degrades to a silent no-op at every missing seam: hooks module not mounted →
  no subscriber; loop-pipeline not importable in the mounting session → resolver returns
  `None`; ContextVar unset (session not spawned by a codergen node) → no write; event without
  `session_id` → skipped. Persister handlers never raise into the session.
- `response.md` is written only when `response_text` is present; infrastructure-failure
  Outcomes (no child output) skip it.

*Addendum (2026-08-17): the persister now REDACTS SECRET-SHAPED MATERIAL AT WRITE TIME (issue
#198), and the "Compatibility" bullet above about silent no-ops does NOT extend to this — a
redaction failure is loud. Incident 2026-08-11: a worker agent ran a tool that dumped its
environment, and the "captured, not reconstructed" property this entry is built on — the
persister writes the worker's REAL `tool:post` payload — meant a literal `OPENAI_API_KEY` value
of the `sk-proj-...` shape (spelled apart here so this ledger is not itself secret-shaped
material) was written verbatim into `<stage_dir>/sessions/<id>/events.jsonl`, which CI then
uploaded inside a PUBLIC run-evidence artifact. (Artifacts deleted, key rotated; a workflow-level scrub-before-upload was added
separately.) That guard sits at the UPLOAD door, one hop downstream of the leak: it can only
clean a file that already holds the credential, and it protects exactly one consumer — anything
else reading the run dir (a maintainer tailing the file, a bug report pasting it, a sandbox that
syncs it) still read a live key. Defense in depth belongs at the WRITE seam, which is
`SessionEventPersister._serialize` — the single place event bytes become file bytes.

**Mechanics.** Each record is serialized, passed through the module's own
`redaction.redact_text`, re-parsed as a validity self-check, and only then appended; each matched
span becomes `[REDACTED:<shape>]`. Redaction runs on the SERIALIZED LINE rather than by walking
the payload because the leak was nested inside a `tool:post` result STRING — a walker has to be
right about every nesting depth, container type and `default=str` coercion, while the serialized
line has no blind spots: whatever is about to be written is exactly what is inspected.

**Shape-targeted, deliberately NOT entropy.** The shapes are a copy of layers 1 and 2 of this
repository's canonical detection set (`.github/capsule-pipeline/scrub_secrets.py`): the known
token prefixes (`sk-`, `github_pat_`, `gh[posur]_`) and end-anchored sensitive `NAME=value`
assignments. Layer 4, the high-entropy heuristic, is NOT ported, and that is the load-bearing
scoping decision rather than an omission — it was MEASURED WRONG on this exact file class
(issue #206: worker-session `events.jsonl` is legitimately full of digests, base64 fragments and
request ids; it blocked the evidence upload on 4 of 4 real runs, and produced 487 entropy-only
findings on run 31689374533). At the upload door a false positive costs one run's evidence; at
the WRITE seam it costs that evidence PERMANENTLY, because the original bytes are never written
at all — which would defeat the forensic-navigation contract above. `redaction.py` is a local
copy and not an import: the canonical script lives under `.github/`, is deliberately stdlib-only
so it runs on a bare Actions runner, and is not a package this module may depend on. A drift
tripwire test loads it BY PATH and asserts the two pattern sets are still identical, so two
copies cannot quietly become two behaviors.

**Loud, never silent.** A scrubbed record carries a top-level
`"redaction": {"count": N, "shapes": [...]}` block beside the inline markers. A CLEAN record is
byte-identical to what this entry originally specified — the key appears only when something was
actually removed — so the record shape documented above still holds for every event that had
nothing to redact, and existing session tooling reading `event`/`timestamp`/`data` is unaffected.
**Fail-loud on redaction failure:** if the machinery raises, the payload is WITHHELD and a
`{"error": <exception type>, "payload_withheld": true}` marker is written in its place. Falling
back to the raw write would resurrect the exact leak; only the exception TYPE is recorded,
because an exception MESSAGE can quote the very bytes that failed to redact.

**Honest residuals.** The canonical set's layer 3 (redacting the literal VALUES of the env vars
the CI job holds) is not ported — it is a workflow-context mechanism, and making write-time
redaction depend on ambient process environment would be non-deterministic and untestable at
this seam; the incident's own credential is covered here twice over, by shape and by assignment.
And the assignment rule matches `NAME=value`, not a JSON key spelled `"api_key": "..."`, so a
SHAPELESS credential in a structured field remains the upload gate's job rather than being
closed by widening a pattern that has already corrupted a shipped artifact once (PR #205). Files:
`modules/hooks-pipeline-observability/amplifier_module_hooks_pipeline_observability/redaction.py`
(new), `.../session_events.py` (`_serialize`). Pinned by
`modules/hooks-pipeline-observability/tests/test_session_events_redaction.py`, which holds all
four directions at once — secret-shaped material redacted AND loud; an innocent runtime-random
value surviving VERBATIM in the same event (the no-over-redaction pin, measured against the
entropy heuristic that WOULD have eaten it); the redaction proved to be AT the write seam
(`events.jsonl` opened exactly once, append-only, the bytes handed to `write()` already clean,
so no post-hoc rewrite could be what cleaned it); and the fail-loud path.*

## 27. `must_write=` Node Attribute — Fail-Closed Artifact Contract

> **This extension adds an artifact-contract enforcement check to the
> engine** (per retry attempt, plus a final post-override backstop).
> It does not conflict with the canonical spec; the spec is silent on
> per-node artifact contracts.  Nodes without `must_write=` are completely
> untouched (opt-in).

### Motivation

The same engine gap has been patched at the graph level repeatedly — every
guard hand-rolled after a live failure:

1. **pm_gate** (`examples/patterns/task-runner.dot`) — the postmortem node
   was observed returning SUCCESS without writing its report; a deterministic
   stub-guard gate now guarantees the file exists.
2. **Verdict gates counting absence as refusal** — in live runs of this
   pattern, a critique node silently ended on plain-text narration without
   writing its critique file; the deterministic verdict gate downstream
   (a grep against the missing file) counted the absence as a refusal, and
   a stall counter killed a run whose tree was ship-quality by direct
   re-verification.
3. **Historical postmortem stubs** — the same "completed without writing"
   shape observed before pm_gate existed.

A box node's contract is often "this file now exists with real content."  The
engine had no way to be told that.  `must_write=` puts the cheapest evidence
check (the artifact exists AND is fresh AND is non-trivial) where every graph
gets it for free, instead of every author rediscovering the trap live.

### What this extension does

A node may declare `must_write=<path>` as a node attribute.  After the handler
returns a non-FAIL outcome, the engine runs a three-axis post-execution check:

1. **Existence:** the file at `<path>` must exist.
2. **Freshness floor (REQUIRED):** `artifact.mtime > node_start_wall`
   (strictly greater than; `time.time()` snapshot taken immediately before the
   handler runs).  A pre-planted file whose mtime predates OR equals the node
   start time FAILS even if it has content — presence alone is exactly the hole
   this contract closes.  The equality case is rejected explicitly: an
   adversary (or a coarse-resolution filesystem) can set an artifact's mtime
   via `os.utime` to match the recorded start time, bypassing a `>=` check.
3. **Non-trivial:** the artifact must contain at least one non-whitespace byte.
   An empty file or a whitespace-only file does not satisfy the contract.

The check runs in two places:

1. **Per-attempt, inside the retry ladder** (`execute_with_retry`): a
   completed attempt (SUCCESS / PARTIAL_SUCCESS) that violates the contract
   consumes a retry attempt exactly like a RETRY outcome — the same shape as
   the fail-closed goal-gate verdict retries (§25).  When attempts are
   exhausted, the violation becomes a loud FAIL with a clear
   `failure_reason` naming the violated axis, and the node routes through
   its normal failure edges (`retry_target`, `condition="outcome=fail"`
   edges, etc.).
2. **As the engine's final backstop, after all outcome overrides**: the same
   check runs again AFTER the `auto_status` promotion and the
   `continue_on_fail` override, so no override can convert an
   artifact-contract violation into a silent success.

If the handler already returned FAIL, the check does not run (no
double-wrapping of failure reasons).

### Path resolution (DESIGN DECISION)

`must_write=` paths follow the same resolution rule as `requires=`:

- **Absolute paths** are used as-is.
- **Relative paths** are resolved against `context.target_dir` if set,
  falling back to `os.getcwd()`.

The task-runner invocation sets `--cwd <target_repo>` and `--param
target_dir=<target_repo>`, so `.ai/postmortem/report.md` in a postmortem node
resolves to `<target_repo>/.ai/postmortem/report.md` — which is the right
place.  Pipeline authors must document which cwd is the anchor in their graph's
invocation comments to avoid the environment-lies class at the contract layer.

### Non-trivial semantics (DESIGN DECISION)

"Non-trivial" means: `content.strip()` is non-empty (at least one
non-whitespace byte).  This is the floor.  Quality (schema, verdict
structure, minimum size) is NOT validated — that remains graph policy.

### Interaction with retries, goal_gate, and continue_on_fail

- **Retries:** a `must_write=` violation **respects `max_retries`** — and the
  mechanism is worth stating precisely, because a plain FAIL outcome is
  *never* re-attempted by `max_retries` in this engine (the retry ladder
  retries only RETRY outcomes and retryable exceptions; see spec §3.5).  The
  contract is therefore checked **per-attempt inside `execute_with_retry()`**:
  a completed attempt (SUCCESS / PARTIAL_SUCCESS) that violates the contract
  consumes a retry attempt exactly like a RETRY outcome, mirroring the
  fail-closed goal-gate verdict retries (§25).  A no-write completion is
  precisely the flaky-failure class where an in-place retry helps —
  re-invoking the handler gives it another chance to produce the artifact.
  With `max_retries=N`, a never-writes node invokes its handler exactly
  `1 + N` times before failing.  When attempts are exhausted, the violation
  becomes a loud FAIL that routes through the node's normal failure edges —
  `retry_target` and `condition="outcome=fail"` graph-routing retries work
  as usual.  `allow_partial=true` does **not** soften the exhausted FAIL to
  PARTIAL_SUCCESS (fail-closed).  This holds on **both** exhaustion paths:
  the completed-attempt path (SUCCESS/PARTIAL_SUCCESS attempts that never
  produced the artifact) AND the RETRY-exhaustion path, where the ladder
  would otherwise manufacture a `PARTIAL_SUCCESS("Retries exhausted,
  partial accepted")` verdict — that manufactured verdict is checked
  against the artifact contract before it is returned.  Retries exhausted
  + `allow_partial` + no artifact is a loud FAIL: no artifact means there
  is nothing to accept partially.
- **SKIPPED (DESIGN DECISION):** SKIPPED means the node did not execute,
  and the artifact contract applies only to **completed executions** — a
  SKIPPED outcome passes through the check unconverted, in both the retry
  ladder and the engine's final backstop.  A legitimately-skipped
  `must_write=` node (runs_on mismatch, failed dependencies, handler-side
  skip) is NOT converted to FAIL for lacking an artifact it was never asked
  to produce.  The one deliberate asymmetry: `auto_status=true` promotion
  (SKIPPED → SUCCESS) runs BEFORE the final backstop, so a promoted node
  counts as a completed execution and the contract applies to it — a node
  that ran, wrote no status, and wrote no artifact is exactly the
  narration-without-artifact class this contract exists to catch.
- **goal_gate:** the FAIL outcome returned by the must_write check has
  `is_explicit=False` (the node never asserted a verdict; the engine forced
  the FAIL).  A `goal_gate=true` node whose must_write check fires cannot
  satisfy its own gate — correct, since it produced no artifact.
- **continue_on_fail:** a `must_write=` FAIL is **non-overridable**.
  `continue_on_fail=true` does NOT suppress it.  The guarantee is by
  **ordering**, not a flag: the engine runs the must_write check as the
  FINAL backstop, after the `auto_status` promotion and the
  `continue_on_fail` override, so any non-FAIL outcome that reaches the end
  of node processing without a fresh, non-trivial artifact is failed there.
  This also covers the adjacent side door: a must_write node whose handler
  FAILED for its own reasons and whose artifact was never written cannot be
  resurrected to SUCCESS by `continue_on_fail=true` — the backstop re-checks
  the artifact contract after the override and fails the node.  A pipeline
  author cannot accidentally (or intentionally) void the artifact contract
  by adding `continue_on_fail=true` to a must_write node.

### Residual: delayed-replant window

The mtime-floor alone leaves a narrow window where an external process writes
a content-bearing file after node start but before the check runs, and the
node's own session never wrote.  **Session attribution** — correlating the
write to this node's `session_id` — is the preferred closing mechanism: it
retires the sibling-plant class entirely (a sibling node pre-writing another
node's declared artifact inside the window).  The mtime floor
is the minimum shipped here; session attribution is deferred.  The test
suite (`test_case4_delayed_replant_informational`) documents this residual
honestly: a delayed replant passes under the mtime-only implementation, by
design and on the record.

### Exemplar adoption

`examples/patterns/task-runner.dot` postmortem node declares
`must_write=".ai/postmortem/report.md"` as the first consumer.  The
`pm_gate` guard remains in place until the contract is live-proven; it is
not removed in this change (per the task's non-goal).

### Guard retirement inventory

What this contract retires, and when — honest on both halves:

- **Already retired by the freshness floor (shipped here):** guard glue that
  exists only to wipe STALE prior-round artifacts before a node re-executes.
  When a node is visited again on a graph cycle, a fresh `node_start_wall`
  is recorded for that execution — a file left over from a previous round
  has an older mtime and cannot satisfy this round's contract.
- **Retires when session attribution lands (deferred):** guard glue against
  SIBLING PLANTS — one node pre-writing another node's declared artifact
  during the delayed-replant window.  The mtime floor cannot distinguish
  that write from the node's own.
- **Retires only after the contract is live-proven:** the **pm_gate stub**
  in `examples/patterns/task-runner.dot` — subsumed by the postmortem
  node's own fail-closed artifact contract (`must_write=` is declared on
  that node in this change, but the deterministic guard is deliberately
  kept; see Exemplar adoption).

**What does NOT retire:**

- **Verdict parsing stays graph policy.**  A write-first skeleton ending
  `VERDICT: PENDING` passes every `must_write=` axis (fresh, authored,
  non-trivial) yet carries no shippable verdict — the task-runner's anchored
  `^VERDICT:` grep still refuses it.  Presence and quality are separate
  contracts by design: `must_write=` moves the presence half into the
  engine; the quality half (anchored verdict parsing, consensus, stall
  counting) remains graph policy forever.

### Backward-compatibility inventory

All existing pipelines are unaffected: the check is opt-in.  No existing node
in the shipped examples declares `must_write=`; the DOT parser already passes
unknown attributes through to `node.attrs` unchanged.  The only new behavior
is for nodes that explicitly add the attribute.

### Files touched

- `modules/loop-pipeline/amplifier_module_loop_pipeline/must_write.py` —
  `check_must_write(node, outcome, node_start_wall, context)`: the shared
  contract check (new module, so `engine` and `retry` can both use it
  without a circular import).
- `modules/loop-pipeline/amplifier_module_loop_pipeline/retry.py` —
  per-attempt check inside `execute_with_retry()`: a completed attempt that
  violates the contract consumes a retry attempt like a RETRY outcome;
  exhaustion returns the loud FAIL (`allow_partial` does not soften it).
- `modules/loop-pipeline/amplifier_module_loop_pipeline/engine.py` —
  `node_start_wall = time.time()` recorded before handler execution;
  `_check_must_write` delegates to the shared check and runs as the FINAL
  backstop (Step 2.7, after the auto_status and continue_on_fail overrides).
- `specs/EXTENSIONS.md` — this entry.
- `examples/patterns/task-runner.dot` — postmortem node gains
  `must_write=".ai/postmortem/report.md"` (exemplar adoption).
- `modules/loop-pipeline/tests/test_engine_must_write.py` — unit tests for
  the adversarial battery cases, relative-path resolution, non-trivial
  semantics, retry semantics (`1 + max_retries` handler invocations,
  retry-then-write success, allow_partial and continue_on_fail
  interactions), backward compat, and the council-amendment battery
  (RETRY-exhaustion manufactured-verdict veto both directions, SKIPPED
  pass-through both levels, auto_status-promotion asymmetry).
- `modules/loop-pipeline/tests/test_retry.py` — exhaustion telemetry truth:
  the `pipeline:stage_failed` event's `final_status` always matches the
  returned outcome (string `allow_partial="false"`, partial acceptance,
  and must_write-vetoed partial).
- `docs/CONTRACTS.md`, `docs/DOT-SYNTAX.md`, `docs/DOT-AUTHORING-GUIDE.md`,
  `context/engine-semantics.md` — retry-ladder truth stated where
  `max_retries` is glossed (the ladder retries RETRY outcomes, retryable
  exceptions, and must_write violations; a plain FAIL is never retried in
  place), plus the continue_on_fail behavior-change sentence.
- `docs/reports/2026-02-20-nlspec-dod-gap-analysis.md` — dated errata note
  for the §11.5 "retried on RETRY or FAIL outcomes | PASS" row.

## 28. Run Provenance Stamping in `manifest.json`

**What:** `manifest.json` (written by the engine at run-directory creation, Spec §5.6) now
includes two additional provenance fields:

```json
{
  "graph_name": "...",
  "goal": "...",
  "start_time": "2026-08-03T00:00:00+00:00",
  "node_count": 3,
  "edge_count": 2,
  "engine_version": "0.1.0",
  "engine_commit": "abc1234..."
}
```

- `engine_version` — the `amplifier-module-loop-pipeline` package version string from
  `importlib.metadata`.  Today this is the static `pyproject.toml` value (`"0.1.0"`);
  it becomes discriminating when the package adopts release tags.
- `engine_commit` — the resolved git commit hash from PEP 610 `direct_url.json`, written
  by uv for git installs.  For editable/dev installs where `direct_url.json` is absent or
  carries no commit, the value is `"unknown"` — stamped honestly rather than guessed.

The standalone runner augments the manifest after each engine run, including a
failed run, with `runner_version`, `runner_commit`, and `provider` fields. Runner
version and commit use the same install-time metadata / PEP 610 mechanism and use
`"unknown"` when that identity is unavailable. `provider` is the runner API/CLI
selection (DOT node-level provider attributes remain the routing authority). One
writer per field — no races.

**Why:** Incident 2026-07-28: the run directory could not self-describe what code produced
it.  The incident analysis had to reconstruct engine identity from install history.  In a
fast-moving repo, "which engine produced this run?" is the first triage question; this
extension makes the run directory answer it durably.  Any cross-run comparison tooling
likewise needs per-run code provenance to be meaningful.

**Honesty contract:** `"unknown"` is the correct value when identity cannot be determined
from install-time metadata without fabricating.  A fabricated provenance field is worse
than an honest gap — stamp `"unknown"` over guessing.

**Compatibility:** Fully backward-compatible.  The five legacy fields (`graph_name`, `goal`,
`start_time`, `node_count`, `edge_count`) are unchanged.  The new fields are additive.
Existing manifest consumers (dashboards, tests reading `manifest.json`) continue to work.

**Runner-engine compatibility assertion:** The `pipeline-runner` package now includes a
startup compatibility assertion (`compat.py`) that checks for required engine symbols before
any node runs.  The chosen shape is a compat-assert (not a pinned dep or single-package
collapse) — see `compat.py` for the tradeoff rationale and the `amplifier-foundation @main`
deferral note.

> here instead.

**What:** A node may declare `feedback_from="<critic_node_id>"` to establish an engine-enforced
feedback accumulation contract. On every `loop_restart` edge traversal, the engine:

1. Reads the named critic node's output from the just-completed iteration's `node_outcomes` (BEFORE
   clearing them).
2. Prepends an iteration label: `"Iteration N critique: <text>"`.
3. Appends the labeled entry to an accumulated channel stored in context under the internal key
   `feedback.channel.<target_node_id>` (e.g. `feedback.channel.generate` for a node named
   `generate`). Each target node gets its own channel key, preventing feedback leakage when multiple
   generator nodes each declare a different critic in the same pipeline.
4. Trims the channel to at most `MAX_CRITIQUES = 5` entries (oldest-first drop — the curation bound).
5. Composes the channel into a newline-joined string and writes it to the **plain** context key
   `prior_critiques_<target_node_id>` (e.g. `prior_critiques_generate`), making it immediately
   available for `$prior_critiques_<target_node_id>` substitution (e.g. `$prior_critiques_generate`)
   in `prompt` attributes on the next iteration. **Delivery is guaranteed:** if the target's prompt
   does not reference the placeholder, the codergen handler appends a labeled critique-history block
   automatically before variable expansion (`feedback.py:ensure_feedback_placeholder()`). The
   placeholder controls WHERE the history appears, never WHETHER it appears — forgetting it cannot
   silently sever the feedback loop.
6. Writes the accumulated channel to a durable artifact at
   `<logs_root>/feedback/<target_node_id>.md`, overwriting it each restart so it always reflects the
   current window.

The critic node's output is resolved in this order: `context_updates["tool.output"]` (full stdout of
a tool node) → `context_updates["tool.last_line"]` → `outcome.notes` (codergen summary) →
`outcome.failure_reason` (if the critic itself failed — still informative feedback).

**Why:** The mathematical heart of the attractor is descent: a retry without critique of the prior
attempt is a coin re-flip (same distribution, new sample); a retry with accumulated critique is
descent. Before this extension, that load-bearing behavior hung on prose: the generator node's prompt
said "check `.ai/feedback/` for prior guidance" — invisible to the engine, unverifiable at run time,
silently lost when a prompt was edited, and dependent on the model choosing to comply every iteration.
One bad day — the exact perturbation the basin exists to absorb — and the loop degraded into an
infinite re-flip with a nicer name, indistinguishable from convergence until the budget died.

`feedback_from=` converts every retry loop from hoping into descending. Whether feedback reaches the
next iteration is now a property of the graph structure, not of model obedience on a given day.

**Curation / token discipline:** The channel is bounded to `MAX_CRITIQUES = 5` entries; each entry
is truncated to `MAX_CRITIQUE_CHARS = 500` characters with a `[…truncated]` suffix. Token cost per
iteration: at most `5 × 500 = 2 500` characters of injected critique — well within typical prompt
budgets. The critique node itself is the primary curator: pipeline authors write the critique node's
prompt to emit a single highest-leverage observation per iteration (the "Pyramid Summary" pattern in
`convergence-factory.dot`). The window bound is a safety net, not the primary curation mechanism.
An unbounded append channel becomes a stagnation attractor — early wrong ideas crowd out corrections;
accumulated critique becomes context poisoning. The bound prevents this.

**Injection carrier:** `prior_critiques_<target_node_id>` (e.g. `prior_critiques_generate`) is a
**plain** (non-dotted) context key. The substitution machinery
(`handlers/codergen.py:_expand_variables`, P7 block) expands only plain keys from context in `prompt`
attributes. Dotted keys (e.g. `feedback.channel.<node_id>`) work in `tool_command` but NOT in prompts
— `context/engine-semantics.md §4`. The internal accumulation channel uses the dotted key
`feedback.channel.<target_node_id>` precisely to avoid prompt expansion; the injected key
`prior_critiques_<target_node_id>` is plain precisely to enable it. Pipeline authors MAY reference
`$prior_critiques_<target_node_id>` in their `prompt` attribute — e.g. `$prior_critiques_generate`
for a node whose `id` is `generate` — to control placement. When the placeholder is absent, the
codergen handler appends a labeled block carrying it before expansion, so the same substitution
path delivers the history either way (declaring `feedback_from=` is sufficient on its own).

**Timing contract:** `collect_and_inject_feedback()` (`feedback.py`) is called at `loop_restart`
time, AFTER the critic node has completed (its output is in `node_outcomes`) and BEFORE
`node_outcomes.clear()` erases it. The injected `prior_critiques_<target_node_id>` key survives the
restart because `context_updates` are intentionally left untouched by the loop_restart block
(`engine.py` Step 6 comment). This is the natural carrier: feedback is another context write that the
restart intentionally preserves.

**Attribute placement:** `feedback_from=` is declared on the **target node** (the generator), not
on the loop_restart edge. This makes the dependency explicit in the graph: the generator node
declares which critic it listens to. Multiple target nodes can each declare different critics.

**Backward compatibility:** Fully opt-in. Nodes without `feedback_from=` are completely untouched —
zero change in behavior. The file-based `.ai/feedback/` convention used by existing pipelines
continues to work. The engine channel is additive: pipelines can use both simultaneously.

**Walk-upstream note:** The canonical spec has no feedback-accumulation vocabulary. This extension
should be proposed upstream: "feedback must accumulate across iterations" is a spec-level claim about
what makes iteration a descent rather than a re-flip. The `attractor lint` tool can grow a
topological rule: "outer loop without a `feedback_from=` channel on any generator node" — a
statically checkable warning that a loop may be re-flipping rather than descending.

**Implementation locations:**
- `amplifier_module_loop_pipeline/feedback.py` — `collect_and_inject_feedback()`, the collection
  and injection logic, and `ensure_feedback_placeholder()`, the prompt-side delivery guarantee
  (analogous to `must_write.py`)
- `handlers/codergen.py: execute() step 1` — calls `ensure_feedback_placeholder()` on the raw
  prompt before variable expansion
- `engine.py: run() Step 6 (loop_restart)` — calls `collect_and_inject_feedback()` BEFORE
  `node_outcomes.clear()`, then continues with the existing restart sequence
- `modules/loop-pipeline/tests/test_feedback_mechanism.py` — unit + integration tests
- `examples/patterns/convergence-factory.dot` — canonical exemplar declaring the contract

**Constants (tunables in `feedback.py`):**
- `MAX_CRITIQUES = 5` — maximum channel depth (oldest-first drop when exceeded)
- `MAX_CRITIQUE_CHARS = 500` — per-entry character cap (truncated with `[…truncated]`)
- `PRIOR_CRITIQUES_KEY_PREFIX = "prior_critiques_"` — prefix for the per-target plain injection key
  (canonical; full key = `PRIOR_CRITIQUES_KEY_PREFIX + node_id`, e.g. `"prior_critiques_generate"`)
- `_CHANNEL_KEY_PREFIX = "feedback.channel."` — prefix for the per-target internal dotted key
  (canonical; full key = `_CHANNEL_KEY_PREFIX + node_id`, e.g. `"feedback.channel.generate"`)
- `PRIOR_CRITIQUES_KEY = "prior_critiques"` — the unscoped key name from the initial design.
  Never written by the engine; retained so tests can assert it is never written (regression
  guard for per-target scoping)
- `_CHANNEL_KEY = "feedback.channel"` — the unscoped channel name; same never-written guard

**Spec-intended alternative (teach this first for new pipelines):** the pattern this extension's
own "Why" section describes as the pre-existing fallback — the generator's prompt reads the
critic's prior output back from a durable artifact — is directly authorable with canonical
vocabulary alone (a `shape=box` prompt plus ordinary loop_restart edges), no engine-enforced
channel required. Worked example:

```dot
critique  [shape=box, prompt="Review the draft at .ai/draft.md. Write your critique to .ai/feedback/critique.md, overwriting any prior content."]
generate  [shape=box, prompt="Read .ai/feedback/critique.md if it exists and address it. Write the revised draft to .ai/draft.md."]

critique -> generate [label="loop_restart", condition="outcome=fail"]
```

This composes with `fidelity=full` continuity (§12) for free — the generator's own prior-turn
messages already carry the critique in-thread — and needs nothing beyond what canonical already
defines. What it does NOT get for free is exactly what motivated §29: guaranteed delivery (a
prompt edit can silently sever the loop), curation (unbounded file growth vs. the 5-entry/
500-char bound), and per-target isolation when multiple generators share one critic.

### What shipped

**1. `Outcome.attempt_count: int | None`** \u2014 the real, 1-indexed attempt count consumed by the
retry ladder. `None` when the outcome never entered the ladder (e.g. the engine's `must_write=`
final backstop, or subgraph/branch execution, which has no retry policy of its own).

- `outcome.py:97` \u2014 field declaration; docstring at `outcome.py:89-96` states the `None` case
  precisely and notes SKIPPED outcomes ARE included (they pass through the ladder without
  looping within it).
- `retry.py` \u2014 populated on every return path of `execute_with_retry()`: the exception-FAIL
  paths (`retry.py:238`, `:263`), the must_write-clean success path (`:277`), the
  must_write-exhaustion FAIL (`:307`), the plain-FAIL return (`:312`), the SKIPPED return
  (`:329`), the manufactured PARTIAL_SUCCESS on retries-exhausted (`:369`), and the manufactured
  FAIL on retries-exhausted (`:387`).
- `engine.py:742` \u2014 surfaced on the `pipeline:node_complete` event as `"attempt": outcome.attempt_count or 1`
  (falls back to `1` for outcomes that never entered the ladder, e.g. the `requires=` skip
  backstop). This is distinct from the pre-existing `"attempt": 1` at `engine.py:510`
  emitted on `pipeline:node_start`, which is a within-handler retry counter kept for backward
  compatibility \u2014 the two fields are not the same signal and consumers should not conflate them.
- `engine.py:615-700` \u2014 the two `Outcome` reconstruction sites (`auto_status` promotion and
  `continue_on_fail` override) carry `attempt_count` (and `failed_step`) forward field-by-field
  instead of dropping them; the reconstructed `Outcome` otherwise resets `is_explicit` to its
  default so a masked/overridden result cannot silently satisfy a `goal_gate=true` node's gate
  (see \u00a725).

**2. `failed_step` generalized from `ToolHandler`-only to `CodergenHandler`.** Previously the
structured `failed_step` payload (\u00a725's backward-compat inventory footnote; originally "Issue 10
/ analog of WS-4 Sub-fix C") was populated only by `handlers/tool.py`. `handlers/codergen.py` now
populates it too, on both its failure paths, with an LLM-appropriate shape:

```
{"prompt": <first 500 chars>, "response_tail": <last 2000 chars, "" not None>, "error": <str>}
```

capped at 8192 total bytes (`_TOTAL_CAP_BYTES`, `codergen.py:268`); when the encoded payload
exceeds the cap, `response_tail` is dropped first and replaced with
`"verification_gap": {"log_filtered": True}` (`codergen.py:299-302`), mirroring `ToolHandler`'s
truncation-marker convention. `response_tail` is always a string, never `None`, matching
`ToolHandler`'s `stdout_tail`/`stderr_tail` convention (`outcome.py:82-83`).

- `handlers/codergen.py:163-172` \u2014 exception path: `_build_failed_step(prompt=prompt,
  response_text=None, error=str(e))`.
- `handlers/codergen.py:206-215` \u2014 goal-gate verdict-recovery path: when `_parse_outcome`
  returns FAIL and no `failed_step` is already set, attaches the same shape with the actual
  `response_text` captured.
- `handlers/codergen.py:271-304` \u2014 `_build_failed_step()`, the shared builder and truncation
  logic for both call sites.

**3. `cycle_index` (0-based)** on manager-loop and pipeline subgraph-completion records, giving
both handlers a common field name for "which repetition" without requiring a consumer to know
each handler's own on-disk numbering convention:

- `handlers/manager_loop.py:417-427` \u2014 `_subgraph_runs` entries gain `"cycle_index": cycle - 1`
  (the handler's own `cycle` counter is 1-based; the on-disk `{manager_node_id}_cycle_{cycle}`
  naming is unchanged).
- `handlers/pipeline.py:315-323` \u2014 the analogous subgraph-completion record gains
  `"cycle_index": _inv`, already 0-based on that path; on-disk `subgraph_{node.id}` /
  `subgraph_{node.id}__iter{N}` naming is unchanged.

**4. `run_subgraph(..., emit_node_events: bool = True)`** \u2014 a new public keyword-only parameter
on `PipelineEngine.run_subgraph()` (`engine.py:933-938`). Previously `run_subgraph()` emitted no
`pipeline:node_start` / `pipeline:node_complete` events at all, leaving `ManagerLoopHandler`'s
in-graph subgraph path (and any other direct caller) entirely dark. `run_subgraph()` now emits
both events for every node it executes, by default. `ParallelHandler` passes
`emit_node_events=False` for its branch engines (`handlers/parallel.py:169,175`) because it
already emits the equivalent events itself, tagged `via_parallel=True`; without the opt-out,
branch nodes would double-count in the timeline.

This parameter replaces a private `_suppress_subgraph_node_events` setattr flag from an earlier
iteration of the same change \u2014 the setattr approach required external code to mutate engine
state and save/restore it around a shared instance. The keyword-only parameter is the one
behavior-affecting piece of this ledger entry: **the default changed from "emits nothing" to
"emits by default,"** which is new signal for any consumer already listening to
`pipeline:node_start`/`pipeline:node_complete` on an engine whose graph contains subgraph or
manager-loop nodes. Existing callers passing only `(start_node_id, context=...)` are unaffected
by the parameter's addition, and the wire shape of the emitted events matches the top-level
`run()` loop's node events (retry-ladder-only fields such as `attempt` fall back to `1`, since
`run_subgraph()` has no retry policy of its own).

**5. `pipeline:stage_retrying` on exception-driven retries.** Before this change, `retry.py` only
emitted `PIPELINE_STAGE_RETRYING` for a RETRY-status outcome or a `must_write=` violation
(`retry.py:290-297`, `:342-349`); an exception raised by the handler itself retried silently.
`retry.py:246-256` adds the same emission on the exception path, with `"reason":
f"exception:{type(e).__name__}"` so a consumer can distinguish an exception-driven retry from a
status-driven one. The event only fires when `attempt < policy.max_attempts` (i.e. another
attempt will actually happen) \u2014 an exhausted exception path returns FAIL directly, as before.

**6. `_branch_id` scoping conventions** for child-engine event disambiguation, used consistently
by both nested-execution handlers:

- `handlers/manager_loop.py:379-382` \u2014 `cycle:{manager_node_id}:{cycle}`, prefixed with the
  parent's own `_branch_id` (if any) via `>` so nesting under a parallel branch stays
  disambiguated.
- `handlers/pipeline.py:258-262` \u2014 `subgraph:{node.id}`, same parent-prefixing convention.

Both sites set `child_engine._branch_id` directly (an attribute read by `_emit`, not a new public
API) rather than threading a new constructor parameter through; this is consistent with how the
existing `ParallelHandler` branch tagging already worked and does not change any wire shape by
itself \u2014 it only prevents concurrent child-engine events (folder subgraphs under parallel
fan-out, nested manager-loop cycles) from being ambiguous about their source.

### Compatibility

**Additive on the wire.** No existing `status.json` / `pipeline:*` event field was removed or
renamed. `Outcome.attempt_count` is a new dataclass field with a `None` default; existing
`Outcome(...)` call sites that do not pass it are unaffected. `"attempt"` on
`pipeline:node_complete`, `"cycle_index"` on the two subgraph-completion records, and the
generalized `failed_step` on `CodergenHandler` failures are all new keys in existing dict
payloads \u2014 a consumer that does not read them sees no change. `pipeline:stage_retrying` on
exception-driven retries is a new *occasion* to emit an existing event with its existing shape,
not a new field.

**One behavior-affecting change: `run_subgraph()`'s default.** Everything else in this entry is
purely additive (new fields on outcomes/events a consumer must opt into reading). The
`emit_node_events` default is different in kind: it changes what a *silent* method now does by
default \u2014 emitting `pipeline:node_start`/`pipeline:node_complete` for every subgraph node where
it previously emitted nothing. A consumer that hooks pipeline events on an engine driving a graph
with subgraph or manager-loop nodes will now see node events for that nested execution that it
did not see before. Any direct caller of `run_subgraph()` that needs the old silent behavior
should pass `emit_node_events=False` explicitly, as `ParallelHandler` does for its branch
engines.

### Implementation locations

- `modules/loop-pipeline/amplifier_module_loop_pipeline/outcome.py` \u2014 `attempt_count` field
  (line 97).
- `modules/loop-pipeline/amplifier_module_loop_pipeline/retry.py` \u2014 `attempt_count` set on every
  return path; exception-driven `pipeline:stage_retrying` emission.
- `modules/loop-pipeline/amplifier_module_loop_pipeline/engine.py` \u2014 `"attempt"` on
  `pipeline:node_complete` (main loop and `run_subgraph()`); `attempt_count`/`failed_step`
  carried through the `auto_status` and `continue_on_fail` `Outcome` reconstructions;
  `run_subgraph(..., emit_node_events: bool = True)` and its node-event emission.
- `modules/loop-pipeline/amplifier_module_loop_pipeline/handlers/codergen.py` \u2014 generalized
  `failed_step` (`_build_failed_step()` and its two call sites).
- `modules/loop-pipeline/amplifier_module_loop_pipeline/handlers/manager_loop.py` \u2014
  `hooks=`/`cancel_event=` wiring onto the child `PipelineEngine`; `cycle_index` on
  `_subgraph_runs` entries; `_branch_id` scoping (`cycle:{manager_node_id}:{cycle}`).
- `modules/loop-pipeline/amplifier_module_loop_pipeline/handlers/pipeline.py` \u2014 `cycle_index` on
  the subgraph-completion record; `_branch_id` scoping (`subgraph:{node.id}`).
- `modules/loop-pipeline/amplifier_module_loop_pipeline/handlers/parallel.py` \u2014
  `emit_node_events=False` on branch-engine `run_subgraph()` calls (avoids double-counting
  branch node events already emitted with `via_parallel=True`).
- `modules/loop-pipeline/amplifier_module_loop_pipeline/pipeline_events.py` \u2014
  `PIPELINE_STAGE_RETRYING` (pre-existing constant; new emission occasion only).
- Tests exercising this surface (added/extended in PR #120, unchanged by this entry):
  `modules/loop-pipeline/tests/test_retry.py`, `test_subgraph_runner.py`,
  `test_manager_loop.py`, `test_parallel_branch_observability.py`,
  `test_p8_continue_on_fail.py`.

## 31. Ledger Entry for PR #134: Retry-Budget Validation (Conformance Restoration) and

> upstream.

**What shipped:**

1. **`retry_budget_non_negative` — a conformance restoration.** The canonical spec declares
   both the graph-level default and the node-level override as typed `Integer` attributes:
   `default_max_retries` (`attractor-spec.md:139`, also `:1993`) and `max_retries`
   (`attractor-spec.md:152`, also `:2010`). Before this PR, the DOT parser silently coerced
   malformed values (`int(val)` truncated fractions like `1.5`→`1`, accepted `True` as `1` since
   Python's `int(True) == 1`, and raised an unhandled `ValueError`/`TypeError` on non-numeric
   strings instead of producing a diagnostic). `_parse_non_negative_retry_count()`
   (`retry.py`) and the new `_check_retry_budgets()` validation rule (`validation.py`) now reject
   negative values, booleans, fractions, and unparseable strings at `validate()` time with a
   named `ERROR` diagnostic, for both the node attribute and both graph-level aliases
   (`default_max_retry` / `default_max_retries`). **This is a restoration, not an extension:**
   the spec already declares these attributes as `Integer`; the implementation previously
   accepted values the spec's own type never permitted, and silently mis-executed rather than
   diagnosing them. No spec change is needed and no `upstream action` applies.

2. **`tool_command_requires_tool_handler` — a stricter-than-spec admission rule.** Canonical
   spec §4.5 (`CodergenHandler`, `attractor-spec.md:656-705`) never reads or references the
   `tool_command` attribute at all; the spec is silent on it for a codergen-resolved node, which
   means a spec-conformant `CodergenHandler` simply ignores a `tool_command` attribute sitting on
   a node it handles — the spec permits (by omission) a graph where `tool_command` is present but
   inert. This PR's `_check_tool_command_handler()` (`validation.py`) makes that shape a
   validation `ERROR`: a non-empty `tool_command` on a node whose *effective* handler resolves to
   a recognized non-tool built-in (codergen, conditional, start, exit, …) is now rejected outright,
   not silently ignored. **This is a real narrowing, plainly stated:** we now refuse to execute a
   graph the canonical spec would admit and run (just with the attribute quietly doing nothing).
   Unrecognized/custom `type=`/`node_type=` values are deliberately exempted (`_effective_handler_type()`
   returns `None` for any unknown explicit type), preserving the custom-handler extension point —
   the rule only fires when the *resolved* handler is a recognized non-tool built-in, never for an
   unregistered extension type the runtime hasn't seen yet.

**Why this framing matters:** conflating the two would either overstate the retry-parsing fix
as a behavior change requiring upstream sign-off (it doesn't — the spec's own `Integer` type
already prohibited the values now rejected) or understate the handler-mismatch rule as "just
tightening validation" without naming that it refuses spec-legal graphs. Recording both
correctly is the point of this entry.

**Compatibility:** The retry-parsing restoration is backward-compatible for every graph that
was already supplying spec-conformant integer retry values; only malformed values that were
previously mis-executed (truncated, coerced, or silently defaulted via an uncaught exception
path) now produce a clear diagnostic instead. The handler-mismatch rule is a **breaking**
narrowing for the specific, narrow case of a `tool_command` attribute present on a node
resolving to a recognized non-tool handler — such a graph now fails `validate()` where it
previously ran with the attribute silently inert.

**Implementation locations:**
- `modules/loop-pipeline/amplifier_module_loop_pipeline/dot_parser.py: _set_graph_attr()` —
  preserves the raw parsed graph-level retry default instead of coercing it at parse time
- `modules/loop-pipeline/amplifier_module_loop_pipeline/retry.py: _parse_non_negative_retry_count()` —
  the shared non-negative-integer parser (used by both the runtime `RetryPolicy` and validation)
- `modules/loop-pipeline/amplifier_module_loop_pipeline/validation.py: _check_retry_budgets()`,
  `_check_tool_command_handler()`, `_effective_handler_type()`
- `docs/DOT-AUTHORING-GUIDE.md` — documents both structural errors under "Static Lint Rules"
- Tests: `modules/loop-pipeline/tests/test_dot_parser.py`, `test_retry.py`, `test_validation.py`

> (the admission-gating entry point) is untouched by this change. Nothing here diverges from or
> narrows the spec, so there is no upstream ask.

**What shipped:** A new `lint()` public entry point (`validation.py`) distinct from
`validate()`/`validate_or_raise()`, plus a CLI subcommand (`attractor lint <file.dot>`) that runs
it. `lint()` runs everything `validate()` runs (LINT-001–018, the structural rules, including the
two admission-gating rules from §31 above) **plus** five additional topological ("basin-lint")
rules that reason about cycle structure and handler semantics rather than per-attribute syntax:

- **TOPO-001** (`ERROR`) — dead conditional edge out of a `diamond` (`ConditionalHandler`) node:
  `outcome!=success` / `outcome=fail` conditions on an edge out of a diamond can never fire,
  because `ConditionalHandler` always returns `SUCCESS` unconditionally and `FAIL` is fail-fast
  (never reaches a diamond via a plain edge). This was the root cause of 8 shipped examples
  carrying dead corrective edges for months before this rule existed.
- **TOPO-002** (`WARNING`) — ambiguous multi-match on a tool node (stale `tool.last_line` +
  `outcome=fail` both matching on a retry visit).
- **TOPO-003** (`WARNING`) — acyclic graph (no corrective cycle at all); flags a candidate for
  "this should have been a recipe, not an attractor," while explicitly allowing deliberate
  one-pass pipelines.
- **TOPO-004** (`WARNING`) — a cycle (SCC) with no explicitly-gated exit edge.
- **TOPO-005** (`WARNING`) — a cycle whose continuation/exit rests solely on LLM say-so, with no
  deterministic (tool or human-gate) evidence gate on the cycle.

*Addendum (2026-08-15): the family has since grown on the same advisory entry point —
**TOPO-006** (`WARNING`, issue #173: failure outcome routed into the terminal success node),
**TOPO-007** (`WARNING`, issue #253: goal-gate retry budget structurally dead when every
success-path walk from the gate's retry target back to the exit crosses a `loop_restart` edge,
whose traversal resets the budget — the ATX-12 fresh-attempt semantics — leaving the loop bounded
only by the step cap), and **TOPO-008** (`WARNING`, issue #254: inert evidence gate — a tool node
that runs a real check and routes on it, but sends two or more distinct `context.tool.last_line`
answers into the terminal success node, so the run ends green whichever answer it got; the
`attractor lint` sibling of the authoring checker's A10, issue #245), and **TOPO-009**
(`WARNING`, issue #226: an `outcome=<status word>` edge condition on a node that also steers
itself by an unconditional status-word `label=` — `outcome` resolves `preferred_label` before
`status` here, the §22 divergence above, so the label silently decides a route the author read
as a status). Listed here so this entry
stays the complete catalog of the `lint()`-only rule family; per this entry's own discriminator
(the **entry point**, not the rule count), none of them owed a new ledger entry. All four are
documented in `docs/DOT-AUTHORING-GUIDE.md` with fix examples.

*Addendum (2026-08-18, issue #200): **TOPO-010** (`WARNING`) joins the same advisory entry point
— a `shape=folder` node whose **static relative** `dot_file=` target is absent at lint time. It is
the author-time sibling of §10's node-entry `ChildDotResolutionError`: the same information, one
step earlier, for the author who simply typo'd a path. It is deliberately advisory and can never be
an ERROR, because the linter cannot distinguish a typo from a child graph an upstream node writes
mid-run — write-then-run composition is a supported shape (§10), and an ERROR would block every
composition graph including `examples/objective/objective-runner.dot`. It skips absolute targets
(a lint-time absolute path says nothing about the run-time machine), any target containing `$`
(resolved from run-time context per §21 — and the exact shape a composition graph uses), and any
graph with an empty `source_dir` (an inline DOT source has no backing file, so there is no honest
base directory to resolve against; the `lint()` library entry point and
`test_examples_lint_clean.py`'s sweep are therefore untouched). `attractor lint` seeds
`graph.source_dir` from the `.dot` file's own directory for this rule, the same way `attractor run`
already does. Measured over this repository's shipped corpus: **zero** of the 33 `examples/**/*.dot`
graphs fire it. Pinned by `test_topological_lint.py::TestFolderDotFileAbsent` and
`modules/pipeline-runner/tests/test_lint_folder_dot_file.py` (the rc=0 contract).*

TOPO-009 is the first rule in the family whose whole subject is a ledgered divergence rather than
a topology defect: §22 / ATX-5 is deliberate and load-bearing, and the rule does not argue with
it — it makes the choice visible to an author who never read the ledger. Its scope was set by
measurement, not by taste: the shape issue #226 first proposed fires on 23 of this repository's
63 shipped `.dot` graphs and the issue's own suggested conservative form on 6, while the shipped
form (the collision scoped to one node's out-edges, and to the unconditional labelled edges spec
§3.3 Step 2 can actually select) fires on zero. That zero is pinned by
`test_topological_lint.py::TestOutcomeLabelShadowingCalibration`.*

*Addendum (2026-08-18, issue #261): **VOCAB-001** (`WARNING`) joins the same advisory entry point,
and opens a second family on it — an *inert-vocabulary* rule, about attribute spelling rather than
topology or command content. It fires on a codergen node that carries **no `prompt=` at all** but
does carry a spelling from `context/dot-reference.md`'s invented-attribute table (`instruction=`,
a node-level `goal=`, `attractor_goal=`, `agent=`, `handler=`, `attractor_handler=`). `dot_parser`'s
`_NODE_FIELD_MAP` promotes exactly `{label, shape, type, prompt}`; everything else survives as an
inert `node.attrs` entry no handler reads — so such a graph parses, validates, and runs its LLM
nodes with no prompt, with no error and no visible difference from a configured one. Measured
(issue #261): two graded sessions authored twelve-node pipelines with `instruction=` on all twelve
nodes and `prompt=` on none; one of them linted **rc=0** with a single unrelated warning. The
near-miss sibling `prompt_on_llm_nodes` (in `validate()`) could not see them: it requires no prompt
**and** no explicit label, and every evidence node was labelled. VOCAB-001 is deliberately advisory
and can never be an ERROR — it infers *intent* from an attribute the engine is entitled to ignore,
and a graph may legitimately carry passthrough attributes the rule does not know about. It skips a
node that has a real `prompt=` (carrying an extra attribute alongside a real prompt is not a
defect), every non-codergen handler (a tool/human-gate/conditional/fan-in/sub-pipeline node never
takes a prompt), start and exit nodes, and — unlike `prompt_on_llm_nodes`'s
`SHAPE_TO_HANDLER.get(shape, "codergen")` — any node whose shape is *unrecognized*, because §38
above makes that a dispatch refusal and `shape_resolvable` already ERRORs on it; treating it as an
LLM node would double-diagnose. Measured over this repository's shipped corpus: **zero** of the 33
`examples/**/*.dot` graphs fire it. Pinned by
`test_inert_vocabulary_lint.py` (including
`test_vocab_001_fires_on_zero_shipped_examples`, the calibration pin, and the false-positive class
in `TestVocab001FalsePositives`). The invalid-`fidelity=` half of issue #261 needed no new rule:
`fidelity_valid` (WARNING, in `validate()`) already reports it, and
`TestFidelityValidCoversIssue261` pins that so it cannot silently regress.*

**Why a separate entry point, not folded into `validate()`:** the five TOPO rules are
judgment calls about pipeline *design quality* (is this graph shaped like a converging
attractor?), not about whether the graph is *executable*. `validate_or_raise()` — the
admission-gating entry point that decides whether a pipeline runs at all — is untouched;
every one of the five rules is reachable only through `lint()`, and only TOPO-001 defaults to
`ERROR` severity within `lint()`'s own exit-code contract (errors → exit 1, warnings → exit 0
unless `--strict`). This is exactly the kind of extension canonical §7.4 anticipates: additional
rules layered on top of, not instead of, the spec's own validation surface.

**Compatibility:** Fully additive. No existing `validate()` or `validate_or_raise()` caller is
affected; `lint()` is a new, separately-invoked surface. A pipeline that was runnable before
this PR remains equally runnable after it — `attractor lint` is an author-time advisory tool,
never consulted by the engine at run time.

**Implementation locations:**
- `modules/loop-pipeline/amplifier_module_loop_pipeline/validation.py` — `lint()` entry point;
  `_check_dead_conditional_edge()` (TOPO-001) and the four sibling TOPO-002–005 checks;
  `_check_inert_prompt_vocabulary()` (VOCAB-001)
- `modules/pipeline-runner/amplifier_module_pipeline_runner/cli.py` — `attractor lint` subcommand
- `docs/DOT-AUTHORING-GUIDE.md` — "Static Lint Rules (`attractor lint`)" section documents all
  five rules with fix examples
- Tests: `modules/loop-pipeline/tests/test_topological_lint.py`,
  `modules/loop-pipeline/tests/test_examples_lint_clean.py`,

### The decision

This was an unledgered divergence: the engine has hard-failed on no-matching-edge since its
initial commit (verified against `git log` — the behavior predates and is unrelated to PR #66,
which only removed a duplicate resume-path check). A session audit found the gap and initially
recorded it with a pending `DECIDE` disposition (ALIGN vs. DIVERGE); that disposition was never
committed to `SPEC_CONFORMANCE.md`, so the decision has been open, undocumented, and — because
`examples/pipelines/practical/bug-fix.dot`'s `escalated` node relies on exactly this hard-fail
behavior to report failure after writing its handoff artifacts (§8 backward-compat note in the
T0-4 restoration above notwithstanding) — **load-bearing** for a shipped exemplar.

**The decision: keep the hard-fail. Never a silent fallback; always a traceable failure
reason.** Rationale: a silent `SUCCESS` on an unrouted, dead-ended graph is the exact incident
class this engine exists to prevent. A real 2.4-hour pipeline run once exited `status=success`
with zero work product because a downstream signal was silently treated as acceptable
completion (see §25's incident motivation for the sibling case at the goal-gate layer). Applying
the spec's dead-end→SUCCESS rule at the main-loop level would reintroduce that same failure
mode one layer up: any graph with a genuinely unreachable or missing edge — an authoring
mistake, not a designed exit — would silently report success instead of surfacing the gap. A
loud, traceable failure (`PIPELINE_ERROR error_type=no_matching_edge`, plus
`terminate_pipeline()`'s `failure_reason`) costs an author a debugging session; a silent false
success costs an operator hours before anyone notices nothing happened.

**No behavior change in this entry.** The engine already behaves this way and has since its
first commit; this entry and the corresponding `SPEC_CONFORMANCE.md` update record the decision
that was made, not a code change.

**Compatibility note — `run_subgraph` behavior updated by issue-172 (separate decision).**
This §33 entry originally reserved any change to `run_subgraph`'s dead-end behavior as a
separate decision. That decision has now been made (issue-172):

- **Conditional-mismatch dead end** (outgoing edges exist but none matched): `run_subgraph()`
  now returns `Outcome(status=FAIL, is_explicit=False)` with a non-empty `failure_reason`
  naming the node and the unmatched outcome. This is consistent with the main loop's
  hard-fail posture above. A dead-ended parallel branch surfaces this failure in
  `parallel.results` (the entry carries `status=fail` and a non-empty `failure_reason`),
  where join policies and the fan-in can aggregate it.
- **No outgoing edges at all** (designed terminus): `run_subgraph()` still returns the last
  outcome unchanged — graceful subgraph completion. The distinction between the two cases
  is: `self.graph.outgoing_edges(current_node.id)` is non-empty (conditional mismatch) vs.
  empty (designed terminus).

The `folder`/`dot_file=` composition path is unaffected — it runs the child via a full child-engine
`run()` call, which already hard-failed on dead ends under this §33 entry.

**Implementation locations:**
- `modules/loop-pipeline/amplifier_module_loop_pipeline/engine.py` — main loop's no-matching-edge
  hard-fail (`terminate_pipeline()` call + `PIPELINE_ERROR` emission with
  `error_type=no_matching_edge`, around the retry-target fallback check)
- `modules/loop-pipeline/amplifier_module_loop_pipeline/engine.py: run_subgraph()` — the
  conditional-mismatch dead-end detection (`outgoing_edges` check after `select_edge` returns
  `None`); returns `Outcome(FAIL, failure_reason=...)` for mismatch, last outcome for terminus
- `modules/loop-pipeline/amplifier_module_loop_pipeline/engine.py: terminate_pipeline()` — the
  sole construction path for a routing-termination outcome in the main loop (see `AGENTS.md`
  common-pitfalls: never construct a fresh `Outcome(FAIL, ...)` inline at this boundary —
  it drops `failure_reason`). Note: `run_subgraph`'s dead-end path constructs its own
  `Outcome(FAIL, ...)` directly, which is correct here because it is not a routing-termination
  in the main-loop sense — it is a subgraph-level routing failure with its own traceable reason.
- `context/engine-semantics.md` §3 — documents both halves (main-loop hard-fail vs.
  `run_subgraph`'s two-case dead-end behavior) and is guarded against drift by
  `modules/loop-pipeline/tests/test_engine_semantics_doc_guard.py` (D-200a/b/c)
- `examples/pipelines/practical/bug-fix.dot` (`escalated` node) — the shipped exemplar that
  depends on this hard-fail to report failure after writing handoff artifacts

**Found by:** a 6-lens council review convened while reviewing PR #133 ("preserve spawned agent
outcomes"). The bug is pre-existing and independent of #133 — present on `main` before and
after that PR — but #133's whole premise (making an explicit child `report_outcome` verdict
survive the `session.spawn` boundary reliably) increases how much pipelines lean on
`suggested_next_ids` surviving that boundary correctly, so the same latent bug becomes more
consequential once spawn-path explicit routing is the norm rather than the exception. PR #133
should merge after this lands; nothing in #133 introduces or worsens the bug below.

**What was broken:** `edge_selection.select_edge()` Step 3 compared
`e.to_node == suggested_id` with no type coercion. `Outcome.suggested_next_ids` travels through
several JSON-parsing paths (`backend.py`: `_find_report_outcome_call`, `_outcome_from_structured_output`,
`_outcome_from_spawn_result`, `_parse_outcome`'s pure-JSON and embedded-verdict-recovery
branches) with no per-element type validation before construction. A spawned child (or any
`report_outcome` caller) that emits a bare-number ID in JSON — `{"suggested_next_ids": [3]}`
instead of `{"suggested_next_ids": ["3"]}`, an easy LLM slip — produced a Python `int`, and
`"3" == 3` is always `False`. Depending on graph shape this manifested two ways:

- **With a competing unconditional edge present:** Step 3 silently failed to match, routing
  fell through to Step 4's weight/lexical tiebreak, and the pipeline silently ran the WRONG
  node. No error, no trace.
- **Without one:** Step 4 also found nothing (fail-fast / no eligible unconditional edge), and
  the engine hard-failed with the generic `"No matching edge from node 'X'"` message, which
  named neither the rejected suggestion nor the edges that existed — untraceable.

**The fix:**

- `edge_selection._coerce_suggested_id()` — normalizes one `suggested_next_ids` entry to its
  canonical node-ID string before comparison. Policy: `str` passes through unchanged; `int`
  (excluding `bool`, a `int` subclass but never a sane ID) is coerced via `str(value)` (`3 ->
  "3"`); anything else (`bool`, `float`, `dict`, `list`, `None`, ...) is a genuinely malformed
  shape, not a type slip, and is rejected — logged as a warning naming the value and its type,
  and skipped so one bad entry doesn't prevent the rest of the list from being tried. Floats are
  deliberately NOT coerced: `3.0` is ambiguous against node `"3"` vs a literal node `"3.0"`, and
  silently picking one would be exactly the "coerce into something plausible" failure mode this
  fix is designed to avoid for compound/ambiguous shapes.
- `engine.PipelineEngine._no_matching_edge_reason()` — the `no_matching_edge` failure message
  (still prefixed `"No matching edge from node 'X'"` for backward compatibility with existing
  substring checks) now appends, when the outcome carried `suggested_next_ids`, the suggested
  IDs and the outgoing edge targets that actually existed, so a genuinely unresolvable
  suggestion (wrong ID, or a shape `_coerce_suggested_id` correctly rejected) produces a
  traceable diagnostic instead of a dead end.
- The goal-gate-retry lookup at `engine.py` (`gate_result.suggested_next_ids[0]` ->
  `self.graph.nodes[retry_node_id]`) applied the same unguarded-comparison *class* of risk (an
  uncaught `KeyError` on a type-mismatched or unresolvable ID) even though it is currently
  protected by `_check_goal_gates()`'s own membership check on the sole path that constructs
  such an outcome today. Hardened to use the same `_coerce_suggested_id` + membership check
  rather than a second, divergent rule for the same "suggested next ID" concept, degrading to a
  diagnosed failure instead of a crash if a future producer ever violates that invariant.

**Grep audit (repo-wide):** every other `self.graph.nodes[...]` dict index in `engine.py`
(`edge.to_node`, `fan_in_node_id`, `start_node_id`, `gate_node_id`) is keyed by an ID the engine
itself derived from the graph's own structure, or already validated via an `in` check
(`_resolve_failure_retry_target`) — none of them consume raw LLM/tool-reported IDs directly. No
other instance of the string/int boundary risk was found in the module.

**What is unchanged:** the JSON-parsing call sites in `backend.py` are untouched — the fix is
applied once, at the actual point of comparison, so it covers every current and future producer
of `Outcome.suggested_next_ids` uniformly rather than duplicating validation at each parse site.

**Tests:** `modules/loop-pipeline/tests/test_spawn_suggested_next_ids_coercion.py` — end-to-end,
through the real `session.spawn` path (`AmplifierBackend._run_via_spawn` -> `_parse_outcome`)
and the real `PipelineEngine`, not synthetic `Outcome` objects. Covers both graph shapes (with
and without a competing fallback edge) with an adversarial, JSON-round-tripped int payload.

## Conformance Restoration Note (T0-4)

**What was retired:** An unledgered dialect where non-`shape=parallel`, non-component nodes
with two or more simultaneously-matching conditional outgoing edges fanned out to ALL matching
targets in parallel (via `select_all_matching_edges` → `_execute_parallel_fan_out`), then
required a fan-in node.  This behavior was never documented in this ledger.

**What was restored:** §3.3 single-edge selection — `best_by_weight_then_lexical(condition_matched)` —
is now the sole edge-selection path for non-`shape=parallel`, non-component nodes.  When
multiple conditional edges simultaneously match, the engine deterministically picks exactly one:
the highest-weight match, with lexical target-id tiebreak.

**What is unchanged:** `shape=parallel` fan-out (extension #18) and component-node parallelism
(ParallelHandler) are untouched.  These are spec-sanctioned explicit parallelism constructs.

**Walk-upstream note (PRINCIPLES.md):** This is a conformance restoration, not a new extension.
No spec change is needed.  The canonical spec at §3.3 already prescribes single-edge selection;
this implementation now fulfills it.  See `SPEC_CONFORMANCE.md` ATX-10 for the ledger entry.

**Compatibility-banner note:** The banner at the top of this ledger promises that community
`.dot` files written against the canonical spec continue to work without modification.  While
the multi-match dialect was live, that promise was compromised for any spec-conformant graph
in which two conditional edges could simultaneously match (the spec prescribes one deterministic
successor; the engine ran both).  With this restoration the engine's edge selection matches the
spec letter, and the banner is true again for edge selection.  Graphs that deliberately relied
on the retired dialect must express parallelism explicitly (`shape=component` or `shape=parallel`,
extension #18).

## 35. Spawned-Agent Outcome Transport and `report_outcome` Ordering Barrier

> **depends-on:** §25
>
> **upstream action:** not applicable — spawned-agent outcome transport is implementor-level semantics inside the canonical backend contract, not a divergence from it. Canonical §4.5 fixes the boundary as `run(node, prompt, context) -> String | Outcome` plus the `status.json` audit trail, and says so in as many words: "How you implement this interface is up to you. The pipeline engine only cares that it gets a String or Outcome back" (`specs/canonical/attractor-spec-canonical.md:715`, `:718`, `:709`). Canonical §1.4 delegates the same way one level up: "What that backend does internally is entirely up to the implementor" (`:58`). A tool-based verdict channel between a child session and its parent lives entirely inside that delegated space — the return contract and the status-file contract are unchanged — so there is nothing here to propose upstream.

**What:** The `loop-agent` orchestrator transports a spawned child's semantic
`report_outcome` verdict through the canonical `orchestrator:complete` event without changing the
orchestrator's `execute(...) -> str` return contract. The mechanism is one chain: the child calls
the `report_outcome` tool; `loop-agent` publishes that verdict as structured metadata on the
completion envelope; foundation's `PreparedBundle.spawn` capture hook copies the metadata verbatim
into the spawn result; and `loop-pipeline`'s backend prefers the explicit verdict over anything it
could infer from the child's prose. `metadata.report_outcome` is the only channel by which a
spawn-path `Outcome` carries `is_explicit=True`.

### Completion envelope

Every `AgentOrchestrator.execute()` invocation emits exactly one `orchestrator:complete` event,
including initialization failures and raised exceptions. Its payload has two deliberately
separate layers:

```json
{
  "orchestrator": "loop-agent",
  "status": "success | incomplete | cancelled",
  "turn_count": 2,
  "metadata": {
    "report_outcome": {
      "status": "success | partial_success | retry | fail",
      "preferred_label": "optional",
      "suggested_next_ids": ["optional"],
      "context_updates": {"optional": "value"},
      "notes": "optional",
      "failure_reason": "optional"
    }
  }
}
```

Top-level `status` is **only lifecycle state**:

- `success` — natural completion
- `incomplete` — max-turn, tool-round, context, or awaiting-input limit; initialization/provider/
  tool-loop exception (event is emitted before the original exception is re-raised)
- `cancelled` — cooperative or task cancellation

The semantic node verdict lives only in `metadata.report_outcome`; it does not redefine lifecycle
status. `metadata` is `{}` when no successful report belongs to that invocation, and interrupted
invocations do not promote a partial report. The mounted report tool's `last_outcome` is reset
before each invocation so state cannot leak between calls. `turn_count` is the per-invocation
number of attempted provider calls, computed from the cumulative provider-call counter.

Because the envelope carries a real lifecycle status, an interrupted child does not reach its
parent disguised as a clean one. Foundation's spawn-result assembly defaults `status` to
`"success"` when no completion event arrives (`_prepared.py`), so the emission is what makes the
difference observable: a child that burned its `max_turns` reports `status="incomplete"`, which is
not in the backend's `_SPAWN_SUCCESS_STATUSES`, so an empty-output limit-terminated child is
recorded FAIL (`"No output from child session"`) rather than a silent success. This is fail-loud
by intent and consistent with §25's fail-closed direction; it is called out here because it
determines an outcome, not merely an observability field. Children that produce output are
unaffected — that path consults the lifecycle status only when no explicit verdict is present.

### Ordering barrier

Ordinary assistant tool-call batches retain configured parallel execution. A batch containing
**at least one** `report_outcome` call is the exception: every call in that batch executes
sequentially in the provider-declared order. This barrier is required because `last_outcome` is a
single semantic completion register. For multiple valid reports, the last successful declared
report wins. A later report that fails argument validation or execution does not erase the prior
valid report. After the complete declared batch finishes, any successful `report_outcome` call
terminates the current outer `execute()` invocation without another provider call or automatic
follow-up processing. Already-queued follow-ups remain queued; they are not cleared or consumed by
the terminal report path and may be processed by a later explicit `execute()` invocation.

### Precedence Policy

A child process may emit both an explicit structured verdict (via `report_outcome`) and trailing
prose in its response. **The precedence rule is explicit: structured `report_outcome` status
supersedes contradicting trailing prose.** A spawned agent that returns `status: fail` in its
report-outcome metadata but then writes "all done, mission accomplished" as closing text is
recorded as FAIL; the documented verdict takes precedence over cheerful prose. The parent
consults `metadata.report_outcome` BEFORE inspecting the prose output, whether that output is
empty or not; only when no explicit verdict is present does the output content determine the
outcome via the §25 verdict-recovery ladder. The spawn path and the direct tool-loop path sit on
the same footing: in both, a tool-declared `report_outcome` is the canonical judgment.

### Compatibility

This is additive at the spawn boundary:

- `execute()` returns the loop's final string unchanged.
- Consumers that ignore `orchestrator:complete.metadata` see the documented lifecycle envelope.
- Spawn consumers opt into explicit verdict transport through `metadata.report_outcome`;
  status-only spawn results are non-explicit.
- Parallel execution is unchanged for batches without `report_outcome`.

### Implementation locations

- `modules/loop-agent/amplifier_module_loop_agent/__init__.py` —
  per-invocation reset, exactly-one completion emission, lifecycle classification, provider-call
  `turn_count`, and `metadata.report_outcome` transport
- `modules/loop-agent/amplifier_module_loop_agent/agent_session.py` —
  provider-call counting, invocation termination reason, the `report_outcome` batch ordering
  barrier, and the terminal report path
- `modules/loop-pipeline/amplifier_module_loop_pipeline/backend.py` —
  spawn-result precedence, semantic `Outcome` reconstruction, response/session preservation, and
  full-fidelity transcript continuity
- `modules/loop-agent/tests/test_orchestrator_completion.py`,
  `modules/loop-agent/tests/test_parallel_gating.py`, and
  `modules/loop-pipeline/tests/test_backend_fidelity.py` — contract tests
- `modules/pipeline-runner/tests/test_spawn_report_outcome_transport.py` — the CROSS-BOUNDARY
  regression. The contract tests above each cover one side of the seam; this one runs the real
  producer (`loop-agent`), the real verdict tool (`tool-report-outcome`) and the real consumer
  (`loop-pipeline`) in a single test, so it proves the envelope TRAVELLED rather than that each
  side would have honored one. It is the test that goes red if the transport is removed.

### RETCON (2026-08-29, maintainer ruling, WAVE 4) -- superseded by the spec-native `status.json` channel

**Ruling:** the spec's own channels -- the returned `Outcome`/`str`, the `status.json` audit-trail
file (Sec 4.5 / Appendix C, Sec 41 below), process exit codes, and plain files -- are RETCONNED as
THE taught and implemented way for a worker (including a SPAWNED child) to deliver an explicit
outcome. `report_outcome` (this section) is not deleted, but it is no longer the primary, taught
mechanism; it is a compatibility channel functional through a deprecation window.

**What changed (WAVE 4, `feat/status-json-worker-transport`):**

- `amplifier_module_loop_pipeline.status_contract` (new) injects the ABSOLUTE path to a node's
  stage-directory `status.json` -- plus the Appendix C envelope -- directly into the instruction
  handed to every SPAWN-capable worker (`backend.py::_run_with_spawn`), via a `ContextVar` mirroring
  `worker_observability.py`'s existing seam so the `CodergenBackend` protocol itself is untouched.
  This is the missing piece that makes Sec 41's status-file contract reachable by a spawned child in
  the first place: a spawned process has no way to discover the path unless told.
- `modules/loop-amplifier-agent` (ruling 5): its `ReportOutcomeTool` `coordinator.mount("tools", ...)`
  reach-in onto the HOSTED amplifier-agent's per-turn coordinator is DELETED, along with the
  `report_outcome`-nudge appended to every prompt. Reaching into a different agent runtime's
  internals to mount a tool it never declared is exactly the internals-reach-in ruling 5 forbids --
  even though the mechanism worked. The hosted amplifier-agent now writes `status.json` with its OWN
  file-editing tools, per the injected instruction; this adapter's own seam shrinks to spawning,
  handing over the (contract-carrying) prompt, and returning the reply -- files and `status.json` are
  the channel, not a tool call this module polices. `metadata.report_outcome` from this adapter is now
  always empty (never fabricated) -- see `tests/test_orchestrator.py::
  test_envelope_shape_never_fabricates_report_outcome`.
- `loop-agent`'s OWN `report_outcome` mechanism (this section, above) is UNCHANGED and keeps working
  -- it is the real, bundled `tool-report-outcome` tool, not a reach-in, and this ruling does not
  retire it during the deprecation window. Its taught system prompts
  (`modules/loop-agent/amplifier_module_loop_agent/prompts/system-{anthropic,gemini,openai}.md`) now
  lead with the status-file contract; `report_outcome` is documented immediately after as
  "legacy, still honored."
- The `direct` worker (in-process tool loop) already satisfied the spec's FIRST channel before WAVE 4
  (it returns an `Outcome` in-process); it is functionally unchanged here. Its own bridged
  `tool-report-outcome` mount is left in place mechanically (nothing else in this change depends on
  removing it) -- ledgered for a follow-up, not touched now.

**Precedence, restated for the spawn path specifically (Sec 41 already governs this generically, now
pinned for spawn too):** `status.json` (filesystem, spec-native, outermost, last-mile) wins over a
`metadata.report_outcome` verdict folded in earlier, in the same turn -- see
`modules/loop-pipeline/tests/test_status_file_contract.py::test_sf011_spawn_both_channels_present_status_json_wins`.
A spawned child using ONLY the old `metadata.report_outcome` channel (no `status.json` at all) is
still honored unchanged -- see
`test_sf010_spawn_metadata_report_outcome_alone_still_works` in the same file.

**Removal:** tracked as a follow-up, not done here. `modules/tool-report-outcome` and `loop-agent`'s
own mounting of it are NOT deleted by this RETCON -- only `loop-amplifier-agent`'s reach-in copy is.

---
### status: REMOVED (2026-08-30, maintainer ruling, WAVE 5 -- `feat/spec-repair`)

**Ruling:** "we allowed drift from the spec to creep in; this release is a repair of that misstep."
`report_outcome` is REMOVED, full stop -- no compat window, no deprecation period. The WAVE 4 RETCON
above (dated 2026-08-29) said removal was "tracked as a follow-up, not done here"; this note is that
follow-up, landing one day later in the same repair effort. This entry's BODY (the completion-envelope
shape, the ordering barrier, the precedence policy) stays put -- the ledger is append-only and describes
what shipped historically -- but none of it is live code any more as of this note.

**What actually changed:**

- `modules/tool-report-outcome/` (the `ReportOutcomeTool` module, its `mount()`, its tests) is DELETED
  in full -- not deprecated, not left importable behind a flag.
- `loop-pipeline`'s `backend.py` no longer reads `metadata.report_outcome` anywhere: the former
  hoisted precedence check in `AmplifierBackend._run_with_spawn` is gone, `_outcome_from_spawn_result`
  only recovers the orchestrator's own lifecycle `status` (never an explicit verdict), and
  `_find_report_outcome_call` is deleted outright (it was the shared helper both the spawn path and
  `_outcome_from_structured_output` called). The direct-worker tool loop
  (`workers/direct_worker.py::_tool_loop_result`) no longer checks for a `report_outcome` tool call
  either. **What is NOT orphaned:** §25's fail-closed explicit-verdict ladder (`_parse_outcome`
  against `result.text` / spawn `output`, with the empty-text goal-gate-fails-closed rule) is
  unconditionally reachable now -- it was already the SECOND rung of the old priority order, so
  deleting the report_outcome-checked-first rung above it left the remaining ladder intact and,
  for the direct path, simplifies to exactly §25's ladder with nothing preceding it. §41's
  `status.json` read-side (`status_file.py::read_status_override`) is wired at the handler layer,
  entirely outside `backend.py`'s spawn/tool-loop methods, so it is untouched by any of this.
- `loop-agent` no longer mounts, resets, or reads a `report_outcome` tool: the per-invocation
  `last_outcome` reset, the `_report_outcome_tool` lookup, and the `metadata.report_outcome`
  population in `_emit_completion` are all deleted. `orchestrator:complete`'s `metadata` is now always
  `{}` -- `loop-agent`'s own "OWNED, not a reach-in" mechanism the WAVE 4 note preserved is exactly
  what this note retires. Its provider-default system prompts
  (`prompts/system-{anthropic,gemini,openai}.md`) drop the "report_outcome (legacy, still honored)"
  section entirely; the status-file contract is the only taught verdict channel now.
  `loop-amplifier-agent` already emitted an empty `metadata.report_outcome` since WAVE 4 (ruling 5)
  and required no further change to that specific behavior.
- `worker-parity-kit`'s fixtures (`broken_worker.py`) and consumer suite (`suite.py`) are re-anchored:
  the deliberately-broken fixtures fabricate a bare `"status": "success"` / `"partial_success"`
  lifecycle envelope with **empty** `metadata` (no verdict mechanism of any kind) instead of a fake
  `metadata.report_outcome` -- proving M3 ("never fabricate a verdict") against the SAME real reader
  (`backend._outcome_from_spawn_result`) the suite always used, now exercising the returned-Outcome /
  `status.json` reality rather than a channel that no longer exists.
- Tests that PINNED the removed precedence are deleted with the behavior, not weakened:
  `test_direct_worker_section35_precedence_regression.py`,
  `test_report_outcome_multiturn_convergence.py`, `pipeline-runner/tests/
  test_spawn_report_outcome_transport.py`, and the `test_sf010_*`/`test_sf011_*` pair in
  `test_status_file_contract.py` (SF-009 stays -- it does not depend on report_outcome). Six
  `report_outcome`-named tests in `loop-pipeline/tests/test_backend.py` and two in
  `test_unified_llm_wiring.py` are likewise deleted. `test_fail_closed_outcomes.py`'s FC-008 keeps
  its still-true `is_explicit=False` status-only half and drops the now-false "with report_outcome"
  half. `loop-pipeline/tests/test_worker_parity.py`'s `DirectWorkerHarness` no longer synthesizes a
  `metadata.report_outcome` envelope -- it never had a real mechanism producing one.
- `bundle.md` and `behaviors/dot-runner.yaml` (the partial that mounted `tool-report-outcome`) are
  updated/deleted accordingly; `pyproject.toml` dependency edges onto `amplifier-module-tool-report-
  outcome` are removed from `pipeline-runner`, `worker-parity-kit`'s comments, and
  `loop-amplifier-agent`.

**Precedence, restated one more time:** the spec's own channels -- the returned `Outcome`/`str`, the
`status.json` audit-trail file (§4.5 / Appendix C / §41), and process exit codes -- are the WHOLE of
the explicit-verdict story now. There is no third, tool-call-shaped channel layered on top.

**Conformance matrix:** rows pinning `report_outcome` behavior are flipped/removed alongside this note
(`specs/conformance/attractor-matrix.yaml`); see that file's own comments for the specific rows.

## 36. Startup Provider Preflight and No-Fallback Profile Resolution (Fail-Loud)

> **depends-on:** none (this closes a fail-open configuration hole; it does not build on or
> narrow any other ledger entry. It is the same fail-closed doctrine as §25 — refuse loudly at
> the earliest static checkpoint instead of degrading silently — applied to provider
> serviceability instead of gate verdicts.)
>
> **upstream action:** not applicable — the canonical spec is silent on provider mounting and
> credential configuration (§4.5 explicitly delegates backend internals to the implementer).
> A startup serviceability preflight and loud profile resolution are implementer-level
> configuration validation; no spec change is needed and community `.dot` files written against
> the canonical spec are unaffected unless they declare a provider the run genuinely cannot
> serve — in which case they previously crashed per-visit or silently ran on the wrong provider.

**Origin (issue #155):** a live `task-runner.dot` run completed its implementation work at
iteration 1, then burned its ENTIRE remaining iteration budget in a crash loop —
`resolve_latest_for: no adapter found for provider 'openai'` — because the `critique_b` node
declares `llm_provider="openai"` (deliberately: dual-family critique) and the environment had no
`OPENAI_API_KEY`. Every round the node crashed; every round the graph re-entered via its
transient-recovery route. Nothing in the run surfaced the cause. Related second mode: with a
provider missing from the `profiles` map, the spawn path silently substituted ANOTHER provider's
profile — a run could report a dual-critic quorum while both critics ran on the same model family.

**What (two changes, one doctrine — a provider misconfiguration costs one clear error at startup,
never a drained budget or a silent substitution):**

1. **Startup preflight** (`loop-pipeline preflight.py`, wired into BOTH engine entry points:
   `PipelineOrchestrator.execute()` and pipeline-runner `drive_engine()`): before the walk
   begins, every node's DECLARED `llm_provider` (explicit attribute or stylesheet-assigned;
   LLM-consuming node types only) is cross-checked against what the run can serve. Unserviceable
   ⇒ `ProviderPreflightError` naming EACH failing node, its provider, and the missing credential.
   Zero nodes execute; zero budget is spent. "Serviceable" is static (no live API call): a
   provider module mounted under that name, or a `profiles` entry whose known credential env var
   (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_API_KEY` / `GEMINI_API_KEY`) is present. Unknown providers with
   a profile get the benefit of the doubt (nothing to check statically).

2. **No-fallback profile resolution** (`backend.py`): the former
   `self._profiles.get(provider, next(iter(self._profiles.values()), ""))` silently routed a
   node whose provider had no profile onto some other provider's profile. The spawn path now
   fails loud (`ValueError`, terminal in the retry ladder — never a crash loop) naming the node,
   the provider, the mounted profiles, and the credential to set. The tool-loop path never
   consumed a profile and is unchanged.

**Deliberate scope boundaries (documented in `preflight.py`):**

- **Declared providers only.** A node with no `llm_provider` uses the engine default
  (`"anthropic"`); the implicit default is NOT policed by the preflight — policing it would make
  simulation mode (no providers mounted; a documented degraded mode) and mock-provider harnesses
  unreachable. The CLI separately preflights the default provider's credential (`cli.py`).
- **Root graph only.** Nested `dot_file` children are loaded mid-walk; their unserviceable
  declarations fail loud at first execution via change 2 rather than at startup.
- **Injected backends skip the preflight.** `execute(..., backend=...)` is the invoker taking
  responsibility for serviceability (mock backends make no provider claims); the auto-constructed
  backend path — the production path — is always checked.
- **Presence, never validity.** The credential check is `env var is set`, not `key works`; a
  hermetic harness satisfies it with a dummy value. An invalid key still fails at the provider
  call — loudly, per §25's fail-closed doctrine.

**Behavior change (intended):** a graph that previously "worked" by silently running a declared
provider on a different provider's profile now refuses (at startup where statically detectable,
at the node otherwise). Degrading to fewer model families must be an explicit graph/bundle
change — never a silent fallback (issue #155 ruling R6: silent single-provider fallback is the
disease, not a remedy).

**Implementation locations:**

- `modules/loop-pipeline/amplifier_module_loop_pipeline/preflight.py` — the check + refusal
- `modules/loop-pipeline/amplifier_module_loop_pipeline/__init__.py` — orchestrator wiring (step 5b)
- `modules/pipeline-runner/amplifier_module_pipeline_runner/runner.py` — `drive_engine` wiring
- `modules/loop-pipeline/amplifier_module_loop_pipeline/backend.py` — no-fallback profile resolution
- `modules/loop-pipeline/tests/test_provider_preflight.py`,
  `modules/pipeline-runner/tests/test_provider_preflight_drive_engine.py` — contract + regression
  tests (including the provider-not-in-profiles class, ruling R5)

*Addendum (2026-08-17): the "never a drained budget" claim above OVERSTATED what change 1
guaranteed, and issue #195 named the residual. A profile is a STRING naming an agent, and the
static definition only asked whether that string was MAPPED — never whether the agent it names
could be RESOLVED. A profile naming an absent agent therefore satisfied "mounted + credential
present", passed the preflight, and then failed at every single spawn
(`AmplifierBackend._run_with_spawn` resolves the profile in exactly one place —
`coordinator.config["agents"]` — and refuses an entry it cannot find). Probed at `37c8f94` on the
#155 graph shape (a failing node on a transient-recovery loop): the run was ACCEPTED at startup
and drained to the engine's 200-step safety bound, executing the unserviceable node 101 times.
Change 1's serviceability definition now has a second, equally static clause: a profile must also
NAME AN ADAPTER THIS RUN CAN RESOLVE. `check_provider_preflight` takes `resolvable_profiles` — for
the spawn backend, the keys of `coordinator.config["agents"]`, the very mapping the spawn path
looks the profile up in — and refuses at startup naming the node, the profile, and what IS
resolvable. It is still a pure config lookup: no spawn, no live call, no side effect. `None` means
"not knowable on this path" (no coordinator, no `session.spawn` — profiles are then never consumed
at all — or a coordinator whose config is not statically inspectable) and skips the clause; it
never means "everything resolves". The credential benefit-of-the-doubt for unknown providers is
NOT extended to it: a profile name is equally checkable for every provider name. Auto-discovered
profiles (§36's own §-neutral extension, issue #196) are resolvable by construction — they ARE the
keys of that agents map — so the clause can never refuse one. Honest residual, stated plainly
rather than re-overstated: this closes the STATICALLY DETECTABLE class only. A profile naming an
agent that exists but whose own provider construction fails inside the spawned child is not visible
to any startup check, and still surfaces per-visit via change 2's terminal `ValueError` — terminal
in the RETRY ladder, which is not the same as terminal at the GRAPH level, and a graph that routes
FAIL onto a recovery loop will still spend its iteration budget on it. Read change 1 as "a
STATICALLY detectable provider misconfiguration costs one clear error at startup", not as a total
guarantee against a drained budget. Also in this change (issue #279, structure not semantics): the
two independent copies of the provider→agent-profile discovery rule — `execute()`'s preflight step
5b and `_build_backend()` — collapse into one `_resolve_profiles(config, coordinator)`, with the
preflight's fail-closed outer handling kept at that call site (a discovery crash yields FEWER
profiles, hence a refusal, never a false accept) and the rot-prone "mirrors `_build_backend()` lines
438-443 exactly" comment replaced by the function reference.
`modules/loop-pipeline/tests/test_profile_resolver_parity.py` pins both call sites to the single
home behaviorally (one monkeypatched resolver must be observed by both in one run), so it is
enforced rather than promised.*

*Addendum (2026-08-17, issue #283): the addendum above wired the new clause into
`PipelineOrchestrator.execute()` only. `drive_engine()` -- the standalone/CLI path, and the
ORIGINAL #155 incident invoker (`attractor run` -> `run_pipeline` -> `drive_engine`) -- kept
calling `check_provider_preflight` with no `resolvable_profiles`, so on that path the clause was
never armed and the key-set-but-adapter-absent class stayed fail-open. The "Implementation
locations" list above named `runner.py` under §36 without that qualification, which read as more
coverage than the path actually had. Probed at `efe9da2` through `drive_engine` on the same #155
graph shape (openai node on a transient-recovery loop, `OPENAI_API_KEY` set, profile
`attractor-openai` mapped, coordinator agents = `attractor-anthropic` only): ACCEPTED at startup,
then drained to the 200-step safety bound -- `Pipeline exceeded 200 steps (safety bound): 4 nodes
x 50` -- with the unserviceable node executed 101 times and 99 real spawns issued for the recovery
node, each failure reading `loop-pipeline recursion guard: agent 'attractor-openai' has
session.orchestrator.module=None`. `drive_engine` now passes the set too, computed by the SAME
shared resolver `execute()` step 5b uses (`_spawn_resolvable_agents(coordinator)`) rather than a
second copy of the rule -- the coordinator is already in scope at that call site, so the answer was
always knowable there; it simply was not asked for. Same fail-closed-when-knowable posture: `None`
still means "not knowable on this path" and still skips the clause (a coordinator with no
`session.spawn` capability never consumes a profile at all, so that path's behavior is unchanged),
and a discovery crash yields the EMPTY set (refuse), never `None`. The set is the key set of
`coordinator.config["agents"]` on the very coordinator object handed to `AmplifierBackend` a few
lines later -- the same mapping `_run_with_spawn` indexes the profile into -- so the preflight can
never judge a different set than the spawn resolves against (the #196 false-refusal failure mode).
The runner's compat gate gained `_spawn_resolvable_agents` as a required engine symbol: it is also
the only available proxy for the `resolvable_profiles` KEYWORD, which a symbol probe on
`check_provider_preflight` cannot see (both landed in the same engine commit, `ccbd89f`).
`modules/pipeline-runner/tests/test_provider_preflight_drive_engine.py` pins both directions on
this path -- the refusal, and the no-false-refusal control (same graph, same credentials, same
profiles map, agent PRESENT -> still runs to success).*

## 37. Bundle Composition: Always-On Guidance, Agent Registration, and Ref-Free Same-Repo Sources

> **This entry is a pure ADDITION in an area the canonical spec does not address.** Nothing
> here changes graph semantics: no parser change, no node/edge/attribute vocabulary change, no
> routing, verdict, retry, or budget behavior change. The change is entirely in how the
> *Amplifier bundle* that hosts this engine mounts its own guidance surfaces into interactive
> sessions and how it references its own modules and skills.
>
> **depends-on:** none
>
> **upstream action:** not applicable — this entry is a pure addition in a spec-silent area,
> not a divergence (`upstream action:` is required only when an entry's banner states the
> behavior DIVERGES from the canonical spec). There is nothing to propose upstream: the
> canonical spec defines the coding agent and pipeline runtime, not the packaging of a host
> platform's bundle.

### Why the spec's silence is not a signal here

The canonical spec specifies what the agent and the pipeline **do** — the graph, its execution
tiers, edge selection, the verdict contract, budgets. It is silent on how a host platform mounts
guidance into an interactive session, because that is not the artifact it governs; a
spec-conformant engine is equally conformant whether its bundle serves 0 tokens of always-on
guidance or 800. The silence is a scope boundary, not a prohibition, and this repo's
`docs/QUALITY_PROTOCOL.md` §3 reaches this far on purpose: *"examples, guidance surfaces and
process changes are classified by it too."* Hence this entry, filed under the Uncharted /
extension tier.

The guidance surfaces themselves (`context/pipeline-awareness.md`, `context/dot-reference.md`,
`agents/attractor-expert.md`, `skills/attractorify/`) already shipped and already paid their own
tolls. This change does not add doctrine; it makes the shipped bundle actually **serve** the
doctrine on the documented install path, where measurement showed it served none of it.

### What changed

1. **Root `bundle.md` gained a `context:` key.** A new `context/attractor-awareness.md`
   (3,246 bytes / 796 cl100k tokens) is now always-on for sessions composed from the root bundle:
   the objective-first trigger and the say-the-names rule, the three-question test, the
   never-clause (the self-report gate is the named anti-pattern), the authoring tripwire
   (consult the expert; `dot-reference.md` is the attribute vocabulary; always `attractor lint`),
   and a pointer block. Before this, `bundle.md` had **no `context:` key at all** and a standard
   `amplifier bundle add git+…@main` install served **zero** always-on guidance.
2. **`agents/attractor-expert.md` is registered.** It was previously referenced by no `agents:`
   YAML anywhere — a 20 KB knowledge file no composition ever loaded. It now carries its own
   mount plan in frontmatter (`session.orchestrator` = loop-agent, Layer-1 =
   `context/system-attractor-expert.md`) and is registered as `attractor:attractor-expert` by
   both `behaviors/attractor-core.yaml` and root `bundle.md`. The inline expert dict in
   `behaviors/attractor-core.yaml` is gone: one expert, one definition.
3. **Same-repo `git+…@main` self-pins became ref-free** wherever foundation's resolution
   semantics allow it (10 of 44): `tools:`/`hooks:` module sources → relative (`../modules/X`),
   and the skills registration → `"@attractor:skills"`. A self-pin at `@main` makes a **branch
   install serve main's bytes**, which is what made branch regression-testing of guidance
   impossible. The remaining 34 are all `session.orchestrator` sources and are **kept
   deliberately**: foundation resolves those against the *composed root's* base_path — the app's
   own bundle directory in a real session — so no relative path written here can reach this
   snapshot, and there is no namespaced module-source form. Measured, not assumed: a build that
   made them relative failed to start in a clean DTU install (`loop-agent: File not found:
   .../amplifier_app_cli/_bundle/behaviors/modules/loop-agent`). Each kept pin carries a comment
   with that measurement so it is not "fixed" later.

### Additive and non-interfering: a spec-conformant graph behaves identically

- **Zero engine-module code changed.** The diff touches `bundle.md`, `behaviors/`, `bundles/`,
  `profiles/`, `agents/`, `context/`, `docs/`, and this file. No file under
  `modules/*/amplifier_module_*/` is modified.
- **Every pipeline composition's served content is unchanged.** The new always-on context is
  placed **root-only**, never in `behaviors/attractor-core.yaml` — which flows into every
  pipeline LLM node. A pipeline node's composed context is byte-identical to before.
- **The flipped sources serve identical bytes.** A relative source resolves inside the same
  snapshot the pin used to fetch, at the ref that was installed; for an `@main` install the
  bytes are the same bytes.
- **Asserted behaviorally.** The guidance eval's `exemplar-01-sloppy-routable` and
  `exemplar-02-honest-redirect` scenarios execute the shipped objective runner through real
  pipeline compositions; both were re-run against this change as the non-interference proof.
- **The conformance matrix and its runner are untouched** (`specs/conformance/attractor-matrix.yaml`,
  `modules/loop-pipeline/tests/test_spec_conformance_matrix.py`). Nothing here is a normative
  statement about graph semantics, so no matrix row is owed: the coverage tripwire requires rows
  for DIVERGES entries, and this is not one.

Design record and probe evidence:
[`docs/designs/2026-08-15-composition-fix.md`](../docs/designs/2026-08-15-composition-fix.md),
including §8's "two resolution classes" finding — the empirical reason the self-pin sweep is
split rather than blanket.

*Addendum (2026-08-18): change 3 above made the skills registration ref-free, but left it declared
only in root `bundle.md` — and change 2's reasoning ("registered by both `behaviors/attractor-core.yaml`
and root `bundle.md`", so every composition gets it) was never applied to skills. The measured
consequence is the same shape as the defect this entry exists to fix, one surface over: a
behavior-only install composes `behaviors/attractor-core.yaml` and never the root, so it registered
`tool-skills` **not at all** and delivered **zero skills** — while still registering
`attractor-expert`, whose guidance directs the reader to `/attractorify`. The pointer shipped
without the destination. `behaviors/attractor-core.yaml` now declares the identical
`"@attractor:skills"` entry, so the behavior stands on its own. This stays inside this entry's
"additive and non-interfering" envelope: no engine module changed, and a pipeline node's composed
content is byte-identical (`tool-skills` mounts a session tool; no LLM-node context is added).
Composing the root is unchanged and **measured** unchanged — foundation merges `tools:` by module id
and de-duplicates list-valued config, so base and head both resolve to one `tool-skills`
registration naming `"@attractor:skills"` exactly once.*

## 38. Unknown Node Shape Hard-Fails at Dispatch (No Default-Handler Fallback)

> here instead.

### The decision

**Keep the raise. A shape selects an execution class; an unrecognized shape must not silently
select the most powerful one.** (Maintainer's standing doctrine applied — Compatibility
doctrine rule 4; decision closes issue #234, F1.)

The named safety property: **no silent execution-class substitution.** A node's shape decides
*who* executes it — a human gate (`hexagon`), a shell command (`parallelogram`), an LLM session
(`box`), a no-op terminal (`Mdiamond`/`Msquare`). Under the spec-literal fallback, any
unrecognized shape — in practice a typo'd semantic shape — silently re-classes the node as a
full LLM session that then reports SUCCESS. The failure is invisible by construction: the run
goes green while the wrong class of thing executed.

The measured evidence that the spec-literal behavior actually failed:

- **The recorded incident (PR #19, commit `aa44fca`).** `shape=diamond` — a *canonical* §2.8
  shape — was missing from the engine's table, and the then-spec-literal
  `SHAPE_TO_HANDLER.get(shape, "codergen")` ran conditional routing points as full codergen
  LLM sessions, silently, until the optimize_bundle investigation caught it. The fallback did
  not merely tolerate a typo; it masked a missing canonical handler for the engine's own
  dispatch table. That commit removed the fallback deliberately ("any unrecognized shape
  (typo, spec mismatch, future shape) would silently run as a full LLM agent").
- **Measured on current main (in-process, no LLM).** Lint emits **zero ERROR diagnostics**
  for a typo'd shape (`deploy [shape=parallelgram, tool_command="./deploy.sh"]` → 0 ERRORs),
  so dispatch is the only tripwire that can catch it. Under spec-literal resolution, the probe
  typos `parallelgram`, `hexagonn`, `Mdaimond`, and `trapezium` all land on codergen: a typo'd
  human-approval gate becomes an unattended LLM node; a typo'd tool node runs an LLM session
  instead of `./deploy.sh`, with `tool_command` silently ignored and the prompt falling back
  to the node label. The lint layer's own message for that node — "LLM node 'deploy' has no
  prompt" — is the reclassification happening live (`validation.py` still classifies with the
  spec-literal fallback for diagnostic purposes; dispatch does not).

The divergence is loud in exactly the doctrine's sense: the refusal names the shape, the node,
the full valid set, and the fix. The spec-literal behavior is the quiet resolution toward
"success" that doctrine rule 4 exists to prevent — same decision shape as §33 (no-matching-edge
hard-fail) and §36 (no-fallback profile resolution), and the same biography as ATX-11: correct,
load-bearing, and (until now) undocumented.

**What conforming would cost, stated honestly.** The fallback is not purposeless: it makes
unmapped decorative shapes (e.g. `shape=ellipse` for a cosmetic LLM node) runnable. A
canonical-conformant graph doing that is refused here. The cost is bounded: the refusal is
loud with a one-line fix, and an explicit `type=` attribute still works with *any* shape —
every decorative rendering remains achievable conformantly (`type=codergen` +
whatever shape the author likes). Weighed against green runs executing the wrong class of
node, the bounded loud refusal wins.

**No behavior change in this entry.** The engine has behaved this way since PR #19; this entry
and ATX-13 record the decision that was made, not a code change.

**Implementation locations:**
- `modules/loop-pipeline/amplifier_module_loop_pipeline/handlers/__init__.py` —
  `HandlerRegistry.get()`: the unknown-shape `ValueError` (names shape, node id, supported
  set, remedy) and the unregistered-handler-type `ValueError` (engine misconfiguration)
- `modules/loop-pipeline/tests/test_no_silent_fallback.py` — the behavior contract (raise,
  message contents, and the regression guard that every §2.8 shape still dispatches)
- `specs/conformance/attractor-matrix.yaml` row `ATX-M-F01` + its probe in
  `modules/loop-pipeline/tests/test_spec_conformance_matrix.py` — asserts both halves: the
  refusal occurs AND the spec's fall-through does not, so silently un-diverging fails CI
  naming this entry

## 39. `reasoning_effort` Has No Engine-Injected Default (Appendix A's `"high"` Does Not Hold)

> **This extension DIVERGES from canonical spec §2.6 and Appendix A.** Canonical spec §2.6

> here instead.

### The decision

**Keep unset-as-unset. The engine never injects a cost- and behavior-bearing LLM parameter the
author did not write; explicit resolution surfaces (node attr → `model_stylesheet` → profile)
are the only sources of a value.** (Decision closes issue #234, F4.)

The named safety property: **no hidden engine default on a provider-mode-switching surface.**
On this engine's shipped provider wiring, `reasoning_effort` is not a mild tuning dial — any
set value switches request *modes*. An engine-injected `"high"` on every node that omitted the
attribute would mean, measured from the shipped adapters:

- **Anthropic** (`unified_llm/adapters/anthropic.py:449-467`): flips every request into
  extended-thinking mode — `thinking={enabled, budget_tokens=16000}` — and **force-overrides
  `temperature` to 1.0** ("Override any caller-specified value; the constraint is absolute"),
  silently rewriting the sampling behavior of every Anthropic node in every community graph.
  Where `max_tokens` is small the budget is silently clamped or thinking silently skipped
  (`max_tokens <= 1024`) — a defaulted "high" that sometimes means "nothing" is a second
  silent substitution on top of the first.
- **OpenAI** (`unified_llm/adapters/openai.py:446-447`): forwards `reasoning={"effort": ...}`
  whenever set — the adapter comments "for o-series models" but nothing gates it by model, so
  a baked-in default sends reasoning parameters to non-reasoning models on every node: live
  400s for graphs that run clean today (the same unconditional-request-shape failure class
  ULM-16 hit live).
- **Gemini** (`unified_llm/adapters/gemini.py:344-351`): `ThinkingConfig(thinking_budget=16000)`
  on every call.
- **Cost**: a 16000-token thinking budget per node call as the *engine's* default, imposed on
  every existing graph that never asked for it. `ULM-7` shipped effort→budget wiring
  live-proven and deliberately **"only when explicitly set"** at the client layer; a
  loop-pipeline default of `"high"` would defeat that decision wholesale from above.

Why the absence is honest rather than a hidden default: a hidden default would be the engine
*writing a value the author cannot see* into the request. This is the opposite — the engine
writes **nothing**. The direct-LLM path sends no reasoning field
(`backend.py`/`__init__.py`: `node.attrs.get("reasoning_effort")` → `None` → adapters send
nothing), the spawn path *omits the key entirely* ("Omitting a key lets the child orchestrator
use its own default", `backend.py` orchestrator_config), and the request actually sent is
inspectable in `Response.raw` (ULM-5). Nothing resolves toward success: no outcome, status,
routing, or gate decision is affected — the author's request reaches the provider exactly as
authored. The spec's own design agrees about where this control belongs: §8's
`model_stylesheet` exists to "centralize model selection so that individual nodes do not need
to specify `llm_model`, `llm_provider`, and `reasoning_effort` on every node"
(`:1449`, `:1561`) — and that surface works here (`* { reasoning_effort: low }` resolves onto
nodes; verified in-process). What does not exist is an unconditional engine constant
underneath it.

**What conforming would cost, stated honestly.** A community author who read Appendix A and
*relied* on omitted-means-high gets shallower provider-default reasoning here — a real, silent
under-delivery relative to the spec's promise. The cure for that author is one stylesheet line
(`* { reasoning_effort: high }`), which this engine honors on every node. The reverse cure —
un-breaking every graph that a baked-in "high" would have flipped into extended-thinking /
temp-1.0 / reasoning-param-400 territory — does not exist. Asymmetric costs; the divergence
takes the recoverable one.

**No behavior change in this entry.** The engine has behaved this way since the attribute was
wired; this entry and ATX-14 record the decision, not a code change.

**Implementation locations:**
- `modules/loop-pipeline/amplifier_module_loop_pipeline/graph.py` — `Node.reasoning_effort:
  str | None = None` (promoted attr; no parser default)
- `modules/loop-pipeline/amplifier_module_loop_pipeline/backend.py` +
  `__init__.py` — `node.attrs.get("reasoning_effort")` passed through as-is on the direct-LLM
  path; spawn path's orchestrator_config drops `None` keys entirely
- `modules/loop-pipeline/amplifier_module_loop_pipeline/stylesheet.py` /
  `transforms.py` — the explicit resolution surface (`model_stylesheet`), which sets the value
  only when a rule matches
- `docs/DOT-AUTHORING-GUIDE.md` node-attribute table — documents the real default (none;
  provider decides) instead of repeating the spec's `high`; pinned two-sided by
  `modules/loop-pipeline/tests/test_doc_consistency.py` (D-243)
- `specs/conformance/attractor-matrix.yaml` row `ATX-M-F04` + its probe in
  `modules/loop-pipeline/tests/test_spec_conformance_matrix.py` — asserts unset stays unset
  through parse *and* transforms, so a silently-introduced default fails CI naming this entry

**What:** Two additive surfaces, both defaulted and both optional for any spec-conformant
`.dot` file:

1. A per-node **`worker=`** attribute selecting which registered worker executes that node,
   e.g. `worker="direct"`. Read via `node.attrs.get("worker")` — no grammar change, no new
   BareValue production.
2. A run-level **worker-selection default**, read from orchestrator config
   (`orchestrator_config["worker"]`, e.g. `PipelineOrchestrator`'s `config["worker"]`, which
   `_build_backend` threads into `AmplifierBackend(..., default_worker=...)`).

**Selection precedence** (highest to lowest), implemented in
`AmplifierBackend._resolve_worker_name`:

1. The node's own `worker=` attribute, if present.
2. The run-level `default_worker`, if configured.
3. Today's capability-fallback chain, unchanged: `"spawn"` if `session.spawn` resolved for
   this run, else `"direct"`.

An unrecognized `worker=` value (or an unrecognized `default_worker` at construction time)
raises `ValueError` naming every known worker — **never a silent fallback**. "Known workers"
is the registry's registered names (today: only `"direct"`) plus the reserved sentinel
`"spawn"`, which is not a registry entry at all (see below).

**The registry, and what it does not manage.** A new `amplifier_module_loop_pipeline.workers`
package holds a `WorkerRegistry` mapping **names** to `Worker` objects, plus the `Worker`
protocol itself: stateless per node visit — `(prompt, context, replayed_history)` in,
`(output, outcome)` out. A worker never receives `graph`/`incoming_edge` — the adapter
(`AmplifierBackend`, still the canonical §4.5 `CodergenBackend` implementation registered as
`ctx.backend`; the outer seam is untouched) resolves fidelity, applies the §5.3 rule-6 resume
degrade, and hands the worker its already-replayed history (node-exchange granularity, §12).
This phase ships exactly one registered worker, `"direct"` — the merge of the former
`AmplifierBackend._run_with_tool_loop` and the standalone `DirectProviderBackend` class (both
now gone; see `modules/loop-pipeline/amplifier_module_loop_pipeline/workers/direct_worker.py`
for the asymmetries the merge resolved). `"spawn"` — the hosted `session.spawn` path — is a
reserved name the adapter recognizes directly, **not** a `WorkerRegistry` entry: the registry
keys names bound to a Python `Worker` instance, and there is no single such instance for
"whichever agent orchestrator module a spawned profile happens to name" (`loop-agent`,
`loop-amplifier-agent`, or an `attractor-agent-*` profile) — that identity is resolved
entirely by the pre-existing `profiles` map and bundle composition, untouched by this entry.

**`llm_provider` reverts to meaning ONLY provider.** Before this entry, a node's declared
`llm_provider` did double duty on the spawn path: selecting a provider AND, via the
`profiles` map, indirectly naming the agent (hence the worker). That map is unchanged and
keeps working as a compat layer for as long as it has consumers — it is not extended, and
`worker=` does not replace it, they are orthogonal: `llm_provider` picks the model family;
`worker=` (or the run-level default) picks the execution mechanism.

**The honest §1.4 tension.** Canonical §1.4 states: "The pipeline definition (the DOT file)
does not change regardless of backend choice." A `worker=` node attribute is in visible
tension with that sentence — a DOT file author who wants a specific mechanism for one node
now has a way to say so in the file. The resolution is not to argue the tension away: a
community `.dot` written to the canonical spec **never needs the attribute** — it is
defaulted at every level, and the run-level default (item 2 above) is the primary control
surface for an opinionated layer that wants to pin a worker without touching individual node
attributes. This satisfies `SPEC_CONFORMANCE.md` compat-doctrine rule 3 ("additive and
non-interfering") — the attribute only adds reachable behavior a conformant graph never
exercises unless its author opts in.

**Compatibility:** Additive and non-breaking, verified by RED-proven pinning tests:

- A zero-attribute, zero-config run resolves the SAME worker as before this entry
  (`tests/test_worker_selection.py`'s default-unchanged proofs): spawn present → the spawn
  path; spawn absent → the `direct` worker (`_build_backend` now always constructs
  `AmplifierBackend`, never a second backend class — see the merge note above — but the
  *observable routing* is unchanged).
- `clone()`/`close()` are registration-time guarantees on every registered worker
  (`WorkerRegistry.register` refuses a worker missing either), closing the silent
  `hasattr`/`getattr`-guard gap the former `DirectProviderBackend` left open
  (`handlers/__init__.py`'s branch clone, `__init__.py`'s finalize path).
- `human.gate.text` injection, `response_schema` (EXT-23), and
  `provider:{request,response,error}` events are uniform across every path that reaches the
  `direct` worker — the former asymmetry (`DirectProviderBackend` alone lacked gate-text
  injection) is closed by construction: `_build_backend` constructs ONE adapter class in
  every case, and gate-text injection happens once, in the adapter, before either path.

**Implementation locations:**
- `modules/loop-pipeline/amplifier_module_loop_pipeline/workers/worker_protocol.py` — the
  `Worker` protocol
- `modules/loop-pipeline/amplifier_module_loop_pipeline/workers/registry.py` —
  `WorkerRegistry`
- `modules/loop-pipeline/amplifier_module_loop_pipeline/workers/direct_worker.py` —
  `DirectWorker`, the merged `direct` worker
- `modules/loop-pipeline/amplifier_module_loop_pipeline/backend.py` — `AmplifierBackend`:
  `_resolve_worker_name` (selection precedence), the registry it owns, and the `_run_with_spawn`
  / `_run_with_tool_loop` dispatch
- `modules/loop-pipeline/amplifier_module_loop_pipeline/__init__.py` — `_build_backend`
  (constructs the ONE adapter in every case; threads `orchestrator_config["worker"]`)
- `modules/loop-pipeline/tests/test_worker_registry.py`,
  `tests/test_worker_selection.py`, `tests/test_direct_worker_merge.py` — the registry,
  selection-precedence, and merge-asymmetry contract tests
- `modules/loop-pipeline/tests/test_worker_parity.py` — this repo's own worker-parity-kit
  admission for the `direct` worker (see `modules/worker-parity-kit/README.md`)

## 41. Status-File Contract Read Side: `status.json` as a Spec-Native Verdict Channel (Conformance Restoration)

> **depends-on:** §25 (fail-closed goal-gate outcomes), §35 (report_outcome spawn transport)
>
> **upstream action:** not applicable — this closes a READ-side gap in our own implementation of
> a mechanism the canonical spec already specifies; there is nothing to propose upstream.

### Conformance gap found

Canonical spec §4.5 (line 709): *"Status file: The handler writes `status.json` in the stage
directory with the Outcome fields serialized as JSON. This file serves as an audit trail and
enables the status-file contract: external tools or agents can write `status.json` to
communicate outcomes back to the engine."* Appendix C (lines 2053–2078): *"Each non-terminal node
writes a `status.json` file in its stage directory. This file drives routing decisions and
provides an audit trail,"* followed by the envelope (`outcome`, `preferred_label`,
`suggested_next_ids`, `context_updates`, `notes`).

Both citations describe a two-way contract: the engine writes `status.json` as its own audit
record, AND an external tool or agent can write one to communicate a verdict back. Before this
entry, only the WRITE half existed (`engine.py: _write_node_status`,
`handlers/codergen.py: _write_status`) — nothing ever read a node-written `status.json` back.
A fixture proved this empirically: a tool node (`parallelogram`, exit code 0) and a codergen node
(backend returning a plain string) each wrote a contradicting `status.json` directly into their
own stage directory; the engine recorded the handler-derived outcome in both cases and the
file was silently ignored (for the codergen path, the handler's own unconditional final
`write_status(stage_dir, outcome)` — spec §4.5 step 5 — actively clobbered the external write
moments later). This is the READ direction of the contract the spec's own words require; it was
a gap in our implementation, not a documented divergence, so this entry is a **conformance
restoration**, not a new behavior.

### What this extension does

`amplifier_module_loop_pipeline/status_file.py` (`read_status_override`) re-reads a node's stage
directory `status.json` after handler execution and, when it diverges from the Outcome the
handler already returned, treats it as the winning verdict:

- **Divergence-gated, not unconditional.** The override applies only when the file's parsed
  envelope differs from what the handler already returned (`status`, `preferred_label`,
  `suggested_next_ids`, `context_updates`, or `notes`). `CodergenHandler` already writes its OWN
  `status.json` mirroring its own returned Outcome as its §4.5 audit-trail step; re-reading an
  identical file is a no-op. Divergence is the actual signal that something OTHER than the
  handler's own routine write touched the file — the "external tool or agent" scenario §4.5
  names. This is also why `is_explicit` is never retroactively flipped for an ordinary
  plain-prose, non-goal_gate codergen response (see the §25 interaction below).
- **Wired at two points.** `retry.py: execute_with_retry()` checks after every attempt (covers
  `ToolHandler` and any handler with no internal status.json write of its own — the file, if
  present, is unambiguously external). `handlers/codergen.py: CodergenHandler.execute()` ALSO
  checks, immediately before its own default-outcome write (both the Outcome-return and the
  string-return paths) — otherwise the handler's own spec-§4.5-mandated final write would
  clobber an external write that landed during `backend.run()` before the handler ever sees it.
- **Freshness floor.** Mirrors `must_write.py`'s convention: the file's mtime must postdate the
  node's execution-start wall clock, so a stale file from an earlier attempt/iteration is never
  picked up as if just written.
- **Malformed ⇒ loud FAIL, never silent.** Invalid JSON, non-object JSON, a missing/invalid
  `outcome` field, or a wrong-typed `preferred_label` / `context_updates` / `notes` fails the node
  (`is_explicit=True` FAIL) regardless of what the handler returned — a broken contract is a
  definitive signal, mirroring §27's `must_write=` fail-closed treatment. `suggested_next_ids` is
  validated only as "a list" (not "a list of strings"): §34 already gives `edge_selection.py`'s
  `_coerce_suggested_id` a documented int/float coercion policy, and re-validating item types
  here would duplicate — and could conflict with — that decided policy. The `outcome` field
  accepts every `StageStatus` value including `"skipped"`, even though Appendix C's illustrative
  comment only lists four: the engine's own writers already serialize `"skipped"` as a normal
  value, and rejecting it here would treat a handler's own routine audit-trail write (e.g. an
  upstream-skip-propagated node) as malformed.

### Precedence — §25's fail-closed ladder, and ordering vs §35's `report_outcome`

A node-written `status.json` is added to §25's producer-classification table as an **explicit**
verdict mechanism: a node/external process directly writing its own structured status file is
exactly as unambiguous as a tool's exit code or a `report_outcome` call (both already `True` in
that table). A divergent, well-formed override therefore carries `is_explicit=True` and CAN
satisfy a `goal_gate=true` node's gate (`engine.py: _check_goal_gates()` requires
`is_success AND is_explicit`) even when the same node's LLM response is bare, non-verdict prose
that §25 would otherwise fail-close to RETRY. This is intentional: Appendix C's own words say a
status.json "drives routing decisions," unqualified by whether the node also emitted a verdict
through the LLM response channel.

Ordering against §35 (`report_outcome` spawn transport): a `report_outcome` verdict is folded
into the handler's returned Outcome BEFORE `handler.execute()` returns — by the time
`read_status_override` runs, any `report_outcome` verdict is already reflected in
`handler_outcome`. A node-written `status.json` that still diverges at that point is a STRICTLY
LATER, out-of-band correction, and wins. Positioned end-to-end: `status.json` (filesystem,
spec-native, Appendix C) is the OUTERMOST, last-mile channel; `report_outcome` (in-process tool
call, §35) sits inside it. This does not retire or reorder §35 itself — `report_outcome` remains
the primary, richer channel for a spawned child (it is available mid-conversation, before the
child's final turn); `status.json` is the coarser, filesystem-level fallback the canonical spec
itself sanctions for tools and agents with no access to the Python `Outcome` return value or the
`report_outcome` tool call at all (e.g. a bare shell `tool_command`). A full retcon of §35 (e.g.
routing `report_outcome` itself through this same file-based channel) is a separate, larger item
and is explicitly NOT done here — `report_outcome` is unchanged.

### Compatibility

Additive and non-interfering (`SPEC_CONFORMANCE.md` compat-doctrine rule 3): a conformant graph
whose nodes never write `status.json` themselves observes IDENTICAL behavior (the override is
divergence-gated and a no-op with no file present). The full `loop-pipeline` suite (2206 tests)
passes unchanged; three RED-only regressions surfaced during development (int-coerced
`suggested_next_ids` already governed by §34, and `"skipped"` already used by the engine's own
writers) were fixed to match existing decided policy, not worked around.

### Implementation locations

- `modules/loop-pipeline/amplifier_module_loop_pipeline/status_file.py` — `read_status_override()`
  (new module)
- `modules/loop-pipeline/amplifier_module_loop_pipeline/retry.py` — `execute_with_retry()`, checked
  every attempt, before the `must_write=` check
- `modules/loop-pipeline/amplifier_module_loop_pipeline/handlers/codergen.py` —
  `CodergenHandler.execute()`, checked immediately before each of its two default-outcome
  `_write_status()` calls; `_write_status()` additionally now writes the canonical `preferred_label`
  key (Appendix C) alongside the pre-existing `preferred_next_label` alias
- `modules/loop-pipeline/amplifier_module_loop_pipeline/engine.py` — `_write_node_status()`, same
  additive `preferred_label` key
- `modules/loop-pipeline/tests/test_status_file_contract.py` — RED-proof (fixture fails without
  the read side, passes with it), goal_gate interaction (SF-006/SF-007), and unit-level
  `read_status_override()` coverage
- `specs/conformance/attractor-matrix.yaml` — row `ATX-M-041`

### WAVE 4 cross-reference (2026-08-29)

The read side described in this section was, before WAVE 4, reachable only by a node/tool that
already knew its own stage directory (a `tool_command`'s own `$PWD`-relative write, or the
CodergenHandler's own audit-trail write). WAVE 4 adds the missing WRITE-side reachability for a
SPAWNED child: `amplifier_module_loop_pipeline.status_contract` tells the child the exact absolute
path, so this section's `read_status_override` now has a spawned-agent producer to read back from,
not just a tool/direct-worker one. See Sec 35's dated RETCON note above for the full account and
`modules/loop-pipeline/tests/test_status_file_contract.py`'s `test_sf009_spawn_node_status_json_override_wins`
(and the `SF-010`/`SF-011` compat/precedence pins) for the spawn-path proof.

## 42. Per-Provider Default Model for `llm_provider`-Alone Nodes (Direct Path, Spec §8.5 Rung 4)

**Classification: implementor-level, NOT a spec divergence.** Canonical spec §8.5 /
Appendix A already name this exact rung — "4. Handler/system default" — as reserved for
the implementor; the spec text names no concrete default models. This entry documents
which content this engine puts in that rung; it does not extend or diverge from spec
text (contrast entry 39, which *does* diverge from an Appendix A default value). No
`SPEC_CONFORMANCE.md` row is added for the same reason.

**depends-on:** none

**The gap (maintainer ruling, LANE D):** `llm_provider` is an nlspec-level node property
(§2.6/Appendix A: `llm_provider` … "auto-detected") and must be honored **spec-first** so
a community `.dot` author is never surprised. Before this entry, a box node that set
`llm_provider=openai` (or `anthropic`/`gemini`) with no `llm_model` died on the direct
path: `_resolve_model()` (`backend.py`) raised unconditionally whenever `llm_model` was
unset, regardless of which provider was declared. Model *choice* remains on
`model_stylesheet` (§8, the spec's own hook) — this entry only fills the terminal rung
that previously always failed loud.

**What shipped:** `_PROVIDER_DEFAULT_MODEL_PATTERN` (`backend.py`) maps `anthropic` /
`openai` / `gemini` to a family token/glob (never a literal, rotting model id — the old
`_DEFAULT_MODELS` table this repo already deleted once, see
`test_profile_no_default_model.py`), resolved **live** via the pre-existing
`unified_llm.resolve_latest_for` machinery (the same path an author gets today from
writing `llm_model=sonnet`). Per unified-llm spec §2.9: "Implementations should default
to the latest available models when no model is specified by the caller" —
`get_latest_model()`/live resolution is the mechanism the spec itself names for this.

| Provider    | Default token | `stable_only` | Why |
|-------------|----------------|---------------|-----|
| `anthropic` | `sonnet`       | `True`        | Existing family token; matches the spec's own §8.6 model_stylesheet example (`* { llm_model: claude-sonnet-4-5; llm_provider: anthropic; }`). |
| `openai`    | `gpt-5.*[0-9]` | `True`        | Current flagship generation (unified-llm spec §2.9: "GPT-5+ series"). Anchored to end in a digit so tier-suffixed siblings (`-mini`, `-codex`) cannot outrank the bare release under the resolver's version-sort — verified empirically: a bare `gpt-5*` glob against `["gpt-5.2", "gpt-5.2-mini", "gpt-5.2-codex"]` picks `gpt-5.2-mini` (wrong). |
| `gemini`    | `gemini-3*pro*`| `False`       | Current flagship generation is the Pro tier (unified-llm spec §2.9: "Gemini 3.1 Pro Preview"). The provider's own current top model is itself `-preview`-named, so the resolver's default `stable_only=True` would filter out every candidate and always raise. |

**Precedence preserved and documented** (spec §8.5 / Appendix A, unchanged rung order):

1. Explicit node `llm_model` attribute — highest precedence (unchanged).
2. `model_stylesheet` rule — already resolved onto `node.llm_model`/`node.attrs` by
   `stylesheet.py`'s `apply_stylesheet` transform *before* `_resolve_model` ever runs, so
   it transparently outranks rung 4 with no code change needed here.
3. Graph-level default — not implemented by any layer today (unchanged; out of scope).
4. **NEW** — per-provider default model-family token (this entry), replacing the
   previous unconditional fail-loud, gated on the node having an **explicit**
   `llm_provider` (raw DOT attribute or stylesheet-resolved — both promote onto
   `node.llm_provider`). A node with **neither** `llm_model` nor `llm_provider` set is
   deliberately left unchanged (still fails loud) — the ruling's surprise-case is an
   author who wrote `llm_provider=` alone, not a fully bare node.

Malformed/unknown providers (no entry in the table) still fail loud, naming the provider
and the known-defaults set — never a silent guess.

**Scope boundary (ruling, honored verbatim):** provider-module integration is untouched
— `unified-llm-client`'s native provider set (`anthropic`/`openai`/`gemini`) is the
complete set this entry covers, by ruling. Model-*role* routing (stylesheet rules keyed
by a semantic role rather than shape/class/id) is explicitly OUT of scope — a future
stylesheet convention, not this entry.

**Spawn path:** unchanged. `AmplifierBackend.run()`'s spawn branch (`backend.py:363-365`)
already tolerates a `None` model (the spawned agent profile / provider_preferences own
that default separately); this entry does not touch it, verified by the full
loop-pipeline suite passing unchanged (spawn-path tests included) after this change.

**Compatibility:** Additive on the direct path only. The three RED-proof unit tests that
previously pinned "provider set, no model → raise" for anthropic/openai/gemini
(`test_profile_no_default_model.py`) are updated in this same change to pin the new,
sanctioned behavior instead (they demonstrably fail against the pre-entry code and pass
after) — this is the exact behavior the maintainer ruling commissions, not an
accommodation of an unrelated regression. The genuinely-bare-node case
(`test_resolve_model_raises_without_explicit_model`) is intentionally left pinned,
unchanged. `docs/DOT-AUTHORING-GUIDE.md` — the file entry 39 documents its
`reasoning_effort` row in — is **not present in this repo**
(`test_doc_consistency.py`'s own skip reason: "opinionated-layer content stayed in
amplifier-bundle-attractor, DESIGN-repo-split.md S3.1"), so this table is documented here
and in `backend.py`'s own docstrings/comments instead.

**Implementation locations:**
- `modules/loop-pipeline/amplifier_module_loop_pipeline/backend.py` —
  `_PROVIDER_DEFAULT_MODEL_PATTERN`, `_resolve_model` (rung 4 fallback),
  `_default_model_stable_only`, `_resolve_concrete_model` (new `stable_only` parameter)
- `modules/loop-pipeline/amplifier_module_loop_pipeline/workers/direct_worker.py` —
  `DirectWorker.run` threads `stable_only` from the rung-4 table only when `llm_model`
  was not explicit
- `modules/loop-pipeline/tests/test_profile_no_default_model.py` — updated RED-proofs
  (provider-alone now resolves; genuinely-bare node still raises; unknown provider still
  raises)
- `modules/loop-pipeline/tests/test_llm_provider_alone_default_model.py` — end-to-end
  `DirectWorker.run()` RED-proofs: provider-alone per provider, full precedence ladder
  (explicit node model / stylesheet model both beat the rung-4 default), unknown-provider
  loud

> **depends-on:** §21 (`$param`/`${key}` variable expansion) — this entry adds a second,
> deliberately narrower substitution surface alongside it, not a replacement.
>
> **upstream action:** not applicable — canonical spec is silent on both a `--param` CLI
> mechanism and graph-level duration attributes generally; this is a pure addition in a
> spec-silent area, not a divergence.

**What:** `dot_parser.parse_dot()` now accepts an optional `params: dict[str, str]` argument.
When a **graph-level DURATION attribute** (today, only `max_pipeline_duration`) holds a value
that is a bare `"$name"` token (the entire stripped attribute value, not a substring or an
embedded reference), the parser substitutes `params[name]` for it and then parses the result
exactly as if that value had been written literally. Any other value (already an int, or a
plain duration/int string) parses unchanged — this is a strict superset of the prior coercion.

**How this differs from §21's `$param`:** §21's substitution is node-level (prompts /
`tool_command`), resolves at **execution time** from `context.get("graph.params_values")`
(`transforms.expand_variables`), and — consistent with "simple string replacement, not a
templating engine" — has no documented fail-loud contract for a missing key. This entry's
substitution is graph-level only, resolves at **parse time** (before any model call), and is
declarative-only by design: a `$name` token whose name is absent from the supplied `params`
raises `ValueError` immediately, naming the missing `--param`. There is no shell-style default
for a missing param and none is planned — an absent fuse value must never silently become "no
fuse" or a surprising built-in constant. The two mechanisms are intentionally independent:
node-level `$param` expansion is completely unaffected by this argument.

**Why:** The lane workflows' `.dot` graphs (`capsule.dot`, `feature-capsule.dot`,
`task-runner.dot`) need their wall-clock fuse (`max_pipeline_duration`) to vary by invocation
(`workflow_dispatch`'s `max_duration` input, honoring the GitHub-hosted 6h job cap) without
hand-editing the graph file per run, while still failing loudly — before any model call burns
budget — if the caller forgets to supply the param.

**Compatibility:** Fully backward-compatible. A graph whose `max_pipeline_duration` is already
a literal int or a plain duration/int string is unaffected whether or not `params` is passed
(RED/GREEN-proofed both directions: a graph without a `$`-token parses unchanged with an empty
or absent `params`; a graph with a `$name` token requires the matching `--param` or fails loud
pre-model-call). Callers that never pass `params` see identical behavior to before this PR,
**except** for a graph that already carries a bare `$name` token in this attribute — such a
graph now requires `params` to resolve it (previously `int("$name")` raised `ValueError` too,
just with a less specific message naming the coercion, not the missing `--param`).

**Implementation locations:**
- `modules/loop-pipeline/amplifier_module_loop_pipeline/dot_parser.py` — `parse_dot()`,
  `_ParseContext.params`, `_resolve_graph_duration_attr()`, `_GRAPH_PARAM_TOKEN_RE`
- `modules/loop-pipeline/amplifier_module_loop_pipeline/remote_dot.py` —
  `load_remote_or_local_graph()` threads `params` through to `parse_dot()`
- `modules/pipeline-runner/amplifier_module_pipeline_runner/runner.py` — `_load_graph()` /
  `drive_engine()` thread `params` through from the CLI's `--param` mapping
- `.github/capsule-pipeline/{capsule,feature-capsule,task-runner}.dot` — first consumers,
  `max_pipeline_duration="$max_duration"`
- Tests: `modules/loop-pipeline/tests/test_dot_render_compliance.py`,
  `test_topological_lint.py` (corpus sweeps updated to supply a placeholder `max_duration`
  param so the shipped `$`-token graphs still parse for lint-only purposes)
