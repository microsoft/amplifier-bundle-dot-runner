# Spec Conformance Ledger

A living record of where this implementation (`amplifier-bundle-dot-runner`) is **off-spec**
relative to the upstream natural-language specs at [strongdm/attractor](https://github.com/strongdm/attractor),
and the chosen disposition for each gap. The goal is not 100% literal conformance — it is that
**every divergence is a deliberate, recorded choice**, trending over time toward one of:

- **ALIGN** — fix the implementation to fulfill the spec.
- **DIVERGE** — keep the implementation's behavior; record it as an intentional, documented
  divergence (and fold it into the spec / `specs/EXTENSIONS.md` so the spec stops lying).
- **IMPROVE** — implementation deliberately exceeds the spec; promote the idea upstream.

## Compatibility doctrine

Maintainer ruling, 2026-08-14. The five rules that decide every disposition in this file:

1. **Honor the nlspec design where possible.** The upstream natural-language spec is the design of
   record; "we'd have done it differently" is not a reason to diverge.
2. **100% support for community `.dot` files built against the nlspec.** A graph written to the
   canonical spec must run on this engine unmodified. This is the hard constraint **on
   extensions** — an extension that breaks a conforming graph is a bug, not an extension. It is
   not a claim that *nothing* can require an edit: the decided **divergences** under rule 4 are
   the enumerated exceptions, and each one names the graph shape it refuses and the one-line
   remedy. Today the divergences that can require touching a conforming graph are `EXTENSIONS.md`
   §16 (fail-fast routing — a graph relying on canonical "continue past FAIL on the best
   unconditional edge" must add `runs_on=always` or `continue_on_fail` to the intended successor)
   and §38 / ATX-13 (unknown-shape hard-fail — a decorative out-of-table shape must carry an
   explicit `type=`). Rule 2 bounds what an *extension* may do; it does not repeal rule 4.
3. **Extensions must be additive and non-interfering.** New attributes, shapes, and semantics may
   only add reachable behavior; they may not change what a spec-conformant graph does.
4. **Divergences only for safety, backed by measured evidence, and always LOUD.** A divergence must
   name the safety property it buys, cite the evidence (an incident, a measurement, a live run) that
   the spec-literal behavior actually failed, and fail loudly rather than silently — a divergence
   that resolves quietly toward "success" is the failure mode this doctrine exists to prevent. Every
   one is ledgered here and in `specs/EXTENSIONS.md`.
5. **Anchoring survives scope.** The strongdm/attractor nlspec is this runner's design of record for
   every use, not only attractor-shaped ones. Consumers are expected to drive this engine in
   recipe-shaped and other non-convergence-loop styles; that broadens what pipelines this engine
   runs, and narrows nothing about what it must conform to. A new use case is never a reason to
   relax rules 1-4: an extension motivated by a non-attractor consumer meets the same
   additive/non-interfering bar as any other, and a divergence meets the same
   safety-plus-measured-evidence bar, ledgered identically in `specs/EXTENSIONS.md` and asserted in
   the conformance matrix. "The spec didn't anticipate this shape" is a reason to file an extension
   entry, not to skip one.

## How to use this file

1. Each gap has a stable ID (`ULM-*`, `CAL-*`, `ATX-*`), a spec reference, an impl reference,
   a **status**, and a **disposition**.
2. When you work a gap: update its status, add a dated line to the Changelog, and — if it's a
   DIVERGE/IMPROVE — make sure `specs/EXTENSIONS.md` documents the real behavior.
3. Keep evidence as `file:line`. Re-verify before flipping a status to DONE — a passing unit
   test of request translation is not the same as proven live end-to-end behavior; note which
   bar was met.

## Status legend

`OPEN` · `IN-PROGRESS` · `DONE` · `WONTFIX` (recorded divergence, no further action)

## Baseline

- Upstream specs read in full @ strongdm/attractor `fb57a55` (unified-llm 2169L, attractor 2090L,
  coding-agent-loop 1467L).
- Spec drift: our vendored `specs/` copies differ slightly from upstream (unified-llm −16L,
  attractor −2L, coding-agent-loop −16L). Only `specs/canonical/attractor-spec-canonical.md` is
  byte-identical to upstream. See `SYNC-1`.

## Summary

| Spec | Areas reviewed | Off-spec gaps | Resolved | Open |
|------|----------------|---------------|----------|------|
| unified-llm | ~35 | 13 | 4 (structured output, all providers) | 9 |
| coding-agent-loop | ~17 | 10 | 3 (bugs CAL-1, CAL-2, CAL-10) | 7 |
| attractor | ~30 | 12 | 9 (ATX-1, ATX-2, ATX-4, ATX-5, ATX-10, ATX-11, ATX-12, ATX-13, ATX-14) | 3 (ATX-3, ATX-6, ATX-7) |

The engine layer (attractor) is the strongest — substantially a **superset** of the spec. The
material weaknesses are concentrated in the LLM client's per-provider metadata and a small set
of deliberate omissions (tool-hooks, execution-environment). Resume is no longer among them:
ATX-2 shipped per §5.3 and coexists with the graph-owned idempotency pattern.

**Note on ULM-1/2/3:** request-translation is proven by deterministic SDK-mocked unit tests.
**Live end-to-end (does each provider actually honor the schema) is UNPROVEN** — needs real API
keys. Do not mark "live" until exercised against real providers (e.g. in a DTU with keys).

**Shipped extensions (IMPROVE — ledgered in `specs/EXTENSIONS.md`):** skip-propagation contracts
(`requires=`/`outputs=`/`failed_outputs`,
`PIPELINE_NODE_SKIPPED`/`PIPELINE_NODE_CONTRACT_VIOLATION`); parallel `k_of_n`/`quorum`/`error_policy`;
human `freeform` mode + attachments; tool `parse_json`/`tool_env`/`tool.last_line`; `$param`/`${key}`
substitution beyond `$goal`. These are additive: they add reachable behavior without changing what a
spec-conformant graph does (doctrine rule 3).

**Fail-fast edge routing (`runs_on`/`continue_on_fail`) is a DIVERGE, not an IMPROVE.** It changes
what a conforming graph does on a FAIL outcome — canonical §3.3 step 4 selects the best unconditional
edge regardless of outcome status; this engine stops unless the target declares
`runs_on` ∈ {`always`, `failure`} or `continue_on_fail`. The load-bearing classification is
conformance-matrix row `ATX-M-016` (`specs/conformance/attractor-matrix.yaml`),
`disposition: DIVERGE-DECIDED`, ledgered at `specs/EXTENSIONS.md` §16 and asserted by
`tests/test_edge_selection_no_silent_fallthrough.py`.

## DECIDE items — context for a future decision

Deferred by owner; not decided yet. Captured context so the future call is well-informed.
Each is **OPEN** with disposition pending (ALIGN vs DIVERGE) unless its heading says otherwise:
an item that has since been decided keeps its subsection here as the record of *why* the call
went the way it did, with its heading and **Status** line carrying the outcome. The tables above
are the current state; these are the reasoning behind it.

### CAL-3 — ExecutionEnvironment abstraction (coding-agent-loop §4)
- **Spec wants:** a swappable `read_file/write_file/exec_command/grep/glob/list_directory` seam with
  Local/Docker/K8s/WASM/SSH implementations + platform metadata.
- **Reality now:** tools self-execute; no environment object is threaded; command timeouts + env
  filtering are owned by the (external) shell/bash tool. `environment.py` only builds the prompt's
  `<environment>` text block, not an execution seam.
- **Coupled to:** CAL-4 (command-timeout/env-filter wiring) and DEAD-1 (we deleted the
  command-timeout `SessionConfig` fields and pointed at the shell tool).
- **Decision hinges on:** do we need sandboxed/remote execution (Docker/SSH/WASM)? If all execution
  stays local via mounted tools → **DIVERGE** (document "tools own execution"). If we want isolation
  or remote targets → **ALIGN** (build the seam). Note Amplifier already provides isolation at a
  different layer (DTU), which may make a loop-level ExecutionEnvironment redundant.
- **Cost if ALIGN:** new abstraction crossing the tool boundary; touches every tool's call contract.

### ATX-2 — Checkpoint-based resume (attractor §5.3) — **DECIDED 2026-08-14: ALIGN (build it) — SHIPPED**
- **Spec wants:** load `checkpoint.json` → restore context/completed-nodes/retry counters → continue
  from the node after `current_node`; degrade `full`→`summary:high` one hop on resume.
- **Reality when this was written (pre-ship, superseded):** engine always restarted from the start
  node; `checkpoint.py` was an observability record (explicitly "not a resume marker");
  `load_checkpoint()` was never used to rehydrate. Idempotency was **graph-owned** only: handlers
  skip already-done work (see `examples/pipelines/12-graph-resume`).
- **Ruling (maintainer, 2026-08-14):** the missing engine-level resume is a **bug in our design**, not
  a defensible divergence. The spec's Definition of Done mandates it outright —
  `specs/canonical/attractor-spec-canonical.md:1857`: *"Resume from checkpoint: load checkpoint ->
  restore state -> continue from current_node"* — so this was never a spec-silent area we were free
  to fill differently. PR #66's premise, that *"the spec does not mandate engine-level resume,"* was
  **false as written**; the disposition recorded on the back of it is withdrawn.
- **Scope of the fix:** engine resume will **coexist with** graph-owned idempotency, not replace it.
  The `examples/pipelines/12-graph-resume` pattern stays supported and documented — handler-level
  "don't redo finished work" remains the right tool for expensive idempotent steps; engine resume
  covers the different problem of restoring accumulated *context* after a crash mid-pipeline.
- **Status: SHIPPED** (issue #224). Engine resume landed per §5.3 and the ATX-2 row above is
  **DONE — PROVEN ON A REALLY-KILLED RUN**: `attractor resume <run_dir>` /
  `resume_pipeline()` / `PipelineEngine.resume()`, opt-in only — a fresh `run()` has no code
  path to a checkpoint loader (`modules/loop-pipeline/tests/test_no_implicit_resume.py`).
  The coexistence condition held: the graph-owned pattern still parses, lints and executes its
  documented guard-skip semantics (`modules/loop-pipeline/tests/test_graph_owned_resume_coexists.py`).
  Design record: `docs/designs/2026-08-14-engine-checkpoint-resume.md`. See the 2026-08-14
  Changelog entry below for the full evidence.
- **Cost:** real state-serialization + rehydration surface; the `full`→`summary:high` degrade rule;
  correctness testing across partial-completion states. Accepted, and paid.

### ATX-3 — Tool-call hooks (attractor §9.7)
- **Spec wants:** `tool_hooks.pre` / `tool_hooks.post` shell commands wrapping every LLM tool call;
  a non-zero pre-hook exit skips the tool call.
- **Reality now:** not implemented (grep `tool_hooks` = 0). A separate `hooks-tool-truncation` module
  exists but implements output truncation, not this pre/post shell contract.
- **Decision hinges on:** do we want per-tool-call shell guards expressed at the *DOT* layer, or is
  this better served by Amplifier's existing kernel/bundle **hook** mechanism (code-decided lifecycle
  hooks)? If the kernel hook system covers the real need → **DIVERGE** (document the alternative). If
  DOT-author-level per-call guards are genuinely wanted → **ALIGN**.
- **Cost if ALIGN:** moderate; a new node/graph attribute + a guarded tool-call execution path.

## Changelog

### 2026-08-29 — ATX-15 DONE: status.json read-side pickup restored (spec Sec 4.5 / Appendix C status-file contract)

**Gap:** canonical spec Sec 4.5 (`attractor-spec-canonical.md:709`) and Appendix C (`:2053-2078`) both describe a two-way `status.json` contract: the engine writes it as an audit trail, AND *"external tools or agents can write `status.json` to communicate outcomes back to the engine"*. Only the write half existed (`engine.py: _write_node_status`, `handlers/codergen.py: _write_status`); nothing ever read a node-written `status.json` back. Proven empirically with a fixture: a tool node (exit 0) and a codergen node (backend returning a plain string) each wrote a contradicting `status.json` into their own stage directory; the engine silently ignored both (for codergen, the handler's own unconditional final write — spec Sec 4.5 step 5 — actively clobbered the external write moments later).

**Fix:** `amplifier_module_loop_pipeline/status_file.py` (`read_status_override`), wired into `retry.py: execute_with_retry()` (every handler type) and `handlers/codergen.py: CodergenHandler.execute()` (before its own audit-trail write, so an external write during `backend.run()` is not clobbered). Applies only when the file DIVERGES from what the handler already returned (so `CodergenHandler`'s own routine self-write, matching its own returned Outcome, is a no-op — `is_explicit` is never retroactively flipped for an ordinary plain-prose response). A malformed file is a loud FAIL, never silent. Added to EXTENSIONS.md Sec 25's producer-classification table as an explicit-verdict mechanism (as unambiguous as a tool exit code or `report_outcome`); ordering against Sec 35's `report_outcome` transport documented (status.json is the outermost, filesystem-level channel; `report_outcome` sits inside it — unchanged, not retired).

**Disposition: ALIGN** (this is conformance restoration, not a new divergence). Ledgered as cross-cutting row ATX-15 below; full narrative in `specs/EXTENSIONS.md` Sec 41; conformance-matrix row `ATX-M-041` in `specs/conformance/attractor-matrix.yaml`. RED-proof + goal_gate-interaction tests: `modules/loop-pipeline/tests/test_status_file_contract.py` (13 tests). Full `loop-pipeline` suite: 2206 passed, 223 skipped, 0 failed (unchanged from before this change other than the 13 new tests).

### 2026-08-29 -- WAVE 4: spawned-worker status.json transport; report_outcome RETCONNED to a compat channel

**Maintainer ruling:** the spec's own channels (returned `Outcome`, `status.json`, exit codes,
files) are the taught AND implemented way for a worker -- including a SPAWNED child -- to deliver
an explicit outcome. `amplifier_module_loop_pipeline.status_contract` injects the exact absolute
`status.json` path (plus the Appendix C envelope) into every spawn-capable worker's instruction
(`backend.py::_run_with_spawn`), closing the reachability gap ATX-15/Sec 41 left for a spawned
child specifically (it had no way to discover its own stage directory). `modules/loop-amplifier-agent`'s
`ReportOutcomeTool` `coordinator.mount` reach-in onto the hosted amplifier-agent's coordinator is
DELETED (separate maintainer ruling: internals-reach-in across agent runtimes is not sanctioned,
even where it worked) -- the hosted agent now writes `status.json` with its own file tools instead.

**Disposition: ALIGN** (conformance restoration/extension, not a new divergence -- same disposition
as ATX-15 above). `report_outcome` (Sec 35) is NOT deleted -- it is a compatibility channel,
functional through a deprecation window; both channels are read, `status.json` wins when they
diverge (Sec 41's pre-existing precedence, now pinned for the spawn path specifically). Full
narrative + dated RETCON note: `specs/EXTENSIONS.md` Sec 35 and Sec 41's WAVE 4 cross-reference.
Tests: `modules/loop-pipeline/tests/test_status_file_contract.py` (`SF-009` spawn RED-proof,
`SF-010`/`SF-011` compat-window + precedence pins), `modules/loop-amplifier-agent/tests/test_orchestrator.py`
(`test_envelope_shape_never_fabricates_report_outcome`), `modules/loop-amplifier-agent/tests/test_spawn_report_outcome_transport.py`
(live, real-network proof the hosted agent writes the file via its own tools).

### 2026-08-26 — CAL-10 DONE: tool:post hook modifications (truncation) reach the LLM again (amplifier-support#485)

- **CAL-10 NEW → DONE — ALIGN.** §5.1's MUST ("tool output exceeds the configured limit, it MUST be
  truncated before being sent to the LLM") was silently unmet in production: `agent_session.py`'s
  tool:post consumer gated on `post_result.action == "modify"`, a value amplifier-core's
  `HookRegistry.emit()` (`hooks.rs`) never returns to its caller — Modify only chains `current_data`
  between handlers *inside* `emit()`'s own dispatch loop; the action returned to the caller always
  collapses to `continue` (or deny/ask_user/inject_context if some handler in the chain requested one
  of those). Dead since `fc85653`. Every `hooks-tool-truncation` modification was a no-op; the LLM
  always received the raw, untruncated output.
  - **Fix (toward-spec, decision-matrix tier):** read `post_result.data` directly — it is the merged
    (possibly hook-modified) event data, delivered under `action="continue"` in the normal case — and
    guard for `"result"` being a `str` that differs from the raw output before using it, because
    Modify *replaces* `current_data` rather than merging it, so `"result"` is not guaranteed present.
    Fixed at both sites in the same class found by grep: `agent_session.py:912-945` (loop-agent's
    live tool-call path) and `loop-pipeline/hook_bridge.py:190-224`'s `wrap_tool_with_hooks` (same
    discard, more severe — it never read `post_result` at all; currently unwired in production, fixed
    as defense-in-depth so it isn't a landmine if wired in later).
  - **Loudness:** both sites now `logger.debug` original→modified char counts whenever a modification
    is actually applied — the incident was a modifier silently no-op'ing for months undetected.
  - **Tests:** `test_truncation_wiring.py` fakes rewritten to be faithful to the real kernel contract
    (`action="continue"`, data replaced) instead of fabricating `action="modify"` back to the caller —
    the old fakes are what let this bug ship silently; `test_tool_post_modification_reaches_llm` is
    RED at `origin/main` (proven: fails against the pre-fix file) and GREEN after the fix; 3 new guard
    tests (missing `"result"`, non-str `"result"`, identical `"result"` → no spurious log). New
    `test_truncation_e2e_real_hook.py` mounts the REAL `hooks-tool-truncation` module on a REAL
    `amplifier_core.HookRegistry` (not a fake) and proves oversized output is truncated to the
    configured `char_limit` before reaching the LLM.
  - **Live-run evidence:** a real `AgentSession` run against a live provider, oversized `bash` output,
    truncation hook mounted — event-stream slice saved outside the repo (see PR notes / report).
  - **EXTENSIONS.md:** not touched — this is a bug fix restoring documented §5.1 behavior, not a new
    or changed behavior surface.
  - loop-agent suite, hooks-tool-truncation suite, loop-pipeline suite, pipeline-runner suite all green
    after the fix (see PR notes for exact counts).

### 2026-08-16 — issue #234 decided: ATX-13 + ATX-14 ledgered as divergences (F1/F4 from the matrix build)

- **ATX-13 NEW — DECIDED — DIVERGE** — unknown node shape hard-fails at dispatch
  (`handlers/__init__.py:116-121`) where canonical §4.2's resolve() falls through to the default
  codergen handler. First ruling made under the decision matrix (`docs/QUALITY_PROTOCOL.md` §3):
  drift tier, full toll paid — named safety property (no silent execution-class substitution),
  measured evidence (PR #19 / `aa44fca`: the spec-literal fallback silently ran `shape=diamond`
  conditional nodes as full LLM sessions when the shape was missing from the table; plus the
  in-process demonstration that lint emits 0 ERRORs for a typo'd shape, so dispatch is the only
  tripwire — spec-literal resolution would run a typo'd tool/human node as an LLM session that
  reports SUCCESS), loud behavior (the raise names shape, node, valid set, remedy), and
  `specs/EXTENSIONS.md` §38 + matrix row `ATX-M-F01` flipped OPEN-PINNED → DIVERGE-DECIDED in
  the same PR. No behavior change — the entry records the decision.
- **ATX-14 NEW — DECIDED — DIVERGE** — `reasoning_effort` has no engine-injected default;
  canonical §2.6 `:162` and Appendix A `:2020` say `"high"`. Drift tier, full toll paid — named
  safety property (no hidden engine default on a provider-mode-switching surface: a baked-in
  `high` would flip every Anthropic node into extended thinking with `temperature` force-set to
  1.0 and a 16000-token budget, send `reasoning` params to non-reasoning OpenAI models — live
  400s for graphs that run clean today — and defeat ULM-7's live-proven "only when explicitly
  set" wiring from above), honest absence rather than substitution (unset-in is unset-out: the
  spawn path omits the key; the direct path sends no reasoning field; `Response.raw` shows the
  request), and `specs/EXTENSIONS.md` §39 + matrix row `ATX-M-F04` flipped OPEN-PINNED →
  DIVERGE-DECIDED in the same PR. `docs/DOT-AUTHORING-GUIDE.md`'s node-attribute table — which
  repeated the spec's `high` as if it held here — corrected and pinned two-sided by
  `tests/test_doc_consistency.py` D-243. No behavior change — the entry records the decision.
- Both were OPEN-PINNED by the matrix (tranche 1) explicitly so this decision would be
  deliberate: the rows pinned today's behavior, refused to launder it into DIVERGE-DECIDED, and
  cited issue #234 as the pending decision. This PR is that decision landing; the issue closes
  with it.

### 2026-08-15 — ATX-4 / ATX-5 status cells reconciled with the conformance matrix (PR #235)

- **ATX-5 OPEN → DONE — DECIDED — DIVERGE.** The status cell said OPEN while the decision had in
  fact been made and ledgered: `specs/EXTENSIONS.md` §22 is the divergence record, it is explicit
  that the behavior is **not** behavior-neutral (a canonical graph matching `outcome=<status>`
  changes meaning once a node sets a `preferred_label`), and `conditions.py:75` has shipped
  `preferred_label or status` deliberately for months. Nothing about the behavior changed here —
  only the cell that had been mis-reporting a made decision as an unmade one. §22 is now cited as
  the decision record in the Disposition cell, matching the ATX-11 / ATX-12 convention.
- **ATX-4 OPEN → WONTFIX — DECIDED (NOT-IMPLEMENTED).** Canonical §9.5 is permissive ("*may* expose
  the pipeline engine as an HTTP service"), so not building it is conformant rather than divergent.
  The decision is: **not building it absent demand** — the bundle exposes programmatic tools and a
  CLI instead. Recorded as WONTFIX per this file's own status legend ("recorded divergence, no
  further action").
- **Evidence that these were stale cells and not new decisions.** PR #235's conformance matrix
  independently classified both rows from the spec text and the shipped code: `ATX-M-022` carries
  `disposition: DIVERGE-DECIDED` citing ATX-5 + EXTENSIONS §22, and `ATX-M-004n` carries
  `disposition: NOT-IMPLEMENTED-DECIDED` citing ATX-4. Two records of the same decision disagreed;
  the matrix was right and the ledger cells were behind. Surfaced by independent adversarial review
  of PR #235.
- **Both rows are now asserted, not merely described.** `ATX-M-022` pins both halves of the
  divergence (`outcome=` resolves to the label when set; to the status when not);  `ATX-M-004n` pins
  the *absence* of an HTTP surface, so shipping one becomes a ledger event rather than a quiet
  feature. The Impl cells cite the matrix rows, making the ledger↔matrix link bidirectional.
- **Dispositions unchanged.** Both cells keep their `DIVERGE` disposition, which is what the matrix
  coverage tripwire (`test_tripwire_every_diverge_atx_row_is_asserted`) reads — a DIVERGE-disposition
  `ATX-*` row must be cited by at least one matrix row. Verified green after this edit.

### 2026-08-14 — ATX-2 DONE: engine-level checkpoint resume shipped (issue #224)
- **ATX-2 DECIDED/IN-PROGRESS → DONE — ALIGN.** Spec §5.3 "Resume behavior" rules 1–6 and DoD
  `:1857` are implemented behind an explicit, opt-in entry point: `attractor resume <run_dir>` /
  `resume_pipeline()` / `PipelineEngine.resume()`. Checkpoint schema v2 is a strict superset —
  the six §5.3 fields keep their exact names and shapes at the §5.6
  `{logs_root}/checkpoint.json` location, plus `schema_version`, `run_state`, `node_outcomes`,
  `engine_state` and `graph` (fingerprint + embedded DOT source). `node_retries` is now actually
  populated (it was always written as `{}`).
  - **Bar met:** proven on a really-killed run, not a simulated interrupt — a subprocess SIGKILLed
    mid-graph after a checkpoint write, resumed by a genuinely separate `attractor resume`
    invocation, asserted equivalent to an uninterrupted control run executed at gate runtime
    (`modules/pipeline-runner/tests/test_resume_e2e.py`).
  - **The two PR #66 crash classes are designed out, not guarded against.** (1) Fresh runs cannot
    be poisoned by a checkpoint: `engine.py` contains no reference to any checkpoint loader at all,
    enforced by `modules/loop-pipeline/tests/test_no_implicit_resume.py`; graph identity is
    evaluated only inside the explicit resume ladder. (2) "No matching edge from resumed node":
    there is no fast-forward replay — the checkpoint records the last COMPLETED node and its real
    outcome, and resume runs edge selection exactly ONCE from those recorded inputs.
  - **Coexistence held (the ALIGN condition):** `examples/pipelines/12-graph-resume.{dot,md}` were
    left byte-unchanged by this PR and still parse, lint and execute their documented guard-skip
    semantics (`modules/loop-pipeline/tests/test_graph_owned_resume_coexists.py`). *(Later: the
    `.md`'s closing prose was reconciled to this coexistence ruling on 2026-08-15 — issue #229 —
    which the byte-pin had deliberately deferred. The `.dot` remains untouched.)* Engine resume answers
    "this process died mid-graph"; graph-owned skip-through answers "this work is already done on
    disk". Neither disables the other.
  - Design record: `docs/designs/2026-08-14-engine-checkpoint-resume.md`. Issue #224.

### 2026-08-14 — documentation/spec-alignment wave (maintainer rulings, in-session)
- **Compatibility doctrine adopted** — added as a header section above: honor the nlspec where
  possible · 100% support for community `.dot` files built against the nlspec · extensions additive
  and non-interfering · divergences only for safety, backed by measured evidence, always loud.
- **ATX-2 OPEN/DECIDE → DECIDED — ALIGN (build it)** — the spec DoD (`:1857`) mandates resume, so the
  gap is a bundle design bug, not a divergence; PR #66's "the spec does not mandate engine-level
  resume" premise was false as written. Engine resume will coexist with graph-owned idempotency
  (`examples/pipelines/12-graph-resume` stays supported). Implementation in flight via the feature
  pipeline, **issue #224**.
- **ATX-12 NEW — DECIDED — DIVERGE** — `loop_restart` is an in-process reset (context preserved,
  `iteration_N/` sub-tree, `$iteration` continuity), not spec §2.7's terminate-and-relaunch with a
  fresh log directory. Deliberate (`docs/plans/2026-02-24-engine-enhancements-design.md:95-102`
  quotes the spec, then chooses otherwise) and load-bearing for `feedback_from=` collection,
  `$iteration` continuity, and context survival. Refiled in `specs/EXTENSIONS.md` §24, which had
  claimed pure additivity.
- **EXTENSIONS §§1–7 retconned as ABSORBED UPSTREAM @ `fb57a55`** — upstream absorbed all seven
  item-for-item; each now carries a `status:` banner citing the canonical section that supersedes it,
  bodies retained verbatim for ledger contiguity. Entry Format amended to define the banner.
- **EXTENSIONS §18 usage check** — upstream removed `k_of_n`/`quorum`/`error_policy` from §4.8 at
  `fb57a55` (they are pure extensions now). Shipped-graph usage: `k_of_n` = 0, `quorum` = 0,
  `error_policy` = 5. `k_of_n`/`quorum` recorded as a subtraction candidate; no code removed.
- **Stale working spec copies retired** — `specs/attractor-spec.md`, `specs/coding-agent-loop-spec.md`,
  `specs/unified-llm-spec.md` contradicted the synced `specs/canonical/*` (five-phase lifecycle,
  `k_of_n`, `preferred_next_label`); replaced with pointer stubs and the one code reader
  (`test_doc_consistency.py::test_spec_default_max_retry_table_is_zero`) repointed at canonical.
- **Docs corrected to match the shipped engine** — `docs/ROUTING-REFERENCE.md` §§3–4 no longer teach
  the "silent alphabetical fallback" (the engine hard-fails `no_matching_edge`; canonical §3.3 returns
  NONE); `README.md` backend table no longer claims `DirectProviderBackend` runs with "no tools".

### 2026-06-24
- **CAL-1 DONE** — `max_tool_rounds_per_input` `0 = unlimited`: loop guard now `_max_rounds <= 0 or round_count < _max_rounds` (`agent_session.py:314`); default aligned to spec `0` (`config.py:39`). Tests added; loop-agent suite 493 passed.
- **CAL-2 DONE** — `ContextLengthError` now emits `AGENT_CONTEXT_WARNING` and returns to IDLE (session stays usable) instead of `fatal_error()` → CLOSED (`agent_session.py:348`). Tests added.
- **ATX-1 DONE** — node `timeout` unit fix: consumers divide parser-ms by 1000 (`engine.py:485`, `handlers/tool.py:105`); `max_pipeline_duration` (ms) untouched. New `tests/test_node_timeout_units.py` (7 tests); loop-pipeline suite 1330 passed.
- **ULM-1/2/3 DONE (translation)** — per-provider structured output: Gemini native `response_mime_type`+`response_schema`; Anthropic tool-based extraction (`__structured_output__` forced tool_choice) with `generate_object` reading tool args; OpenAI confirmed. Fail-loud (`ConfigurationError`) on Anthropic json-without-schema. 9 tests added; unified-llm suite 636 passed. **Live end-to-end remains UNPROVEN (needs real API keys).**
- **ULM-7 / ULM-9 / ULM-10 DONE** ("silent-drop" PR) — three fail-loud/no-op fixes: **ULM-7** `reasoning_effort` now wired to Anthropic extended-thinking (`thinking` budget + beta header, temp=1, budget<max_tokens) and Gemini `ThinkingConfig` (effort→budget 1024/8000/16000), only when explicitly set — **live-proven** both providers accept it and reason (Gemini: correct bat-and-ball reasoning; Anthropic: thinking block in raw, correct answer; honest note: Gemini's `reasoning_tokens` usage field is variable for flash-lite — request-translation asserted by unit tests). **ULM-9** `errors.py::_classify_by_message()` promotes generic errors → `QuotaExceededError`/`ContextLengthError`/`ContentFilterError` by substring. **ULM-10** all 4 adapters now `raise ConfigurationError` on unhandled Audio/Document content (provider + kind named) instead of silently dropping. +38 unit tests; unified-llm suite 724 green; structured-output eval 6/6×3 no regression (re-verified by my own run).
- **ULM-17 DONE — DIVERGE confirmed (no fix)** — ran an adversarial extra-keys eval (3 "extract everything" prompts × 3-field `additionalProperties:false` schemas, 9 live calls): **0/3 leaked on Gemini** (and OpenAI/Anthropic). Gemini's structured-output mode treats `properties` as the authoritative allowed-key set even though our sanitizer strips the keyword. The "stripping causes leakage" hypothesis is falsified for flat schemas under adversarial pressure; the sanitizer trade-off is benign in practice. Documented as an accepted divergence; no code change. (Minor side-note, parked: when a schema's JSON-Schema `title` *metadata* shares a name with a `title` *property*, OpenAI may echo the metadata — a test-schema-design artifact, not a product bug.)
- **ULM-16 DONE — LIVE-PROVEN** — eval found OpenAI strict mode 400s on any schema with optional fields. Added `adapters/_openai_strict_schema.py::make_openai_strict_schema()` (deep-copy transform: every object → `additionalProperties:false` + `required`=all keys; originally-optional fields widened to nullable), applied in `openai.py` + `openai_compat.py` strict path; never mutates caller schema. +10 mocked tests; unified-llm suite 686 green. Live structured-output eval: OpenAI 5/6→**6/6** (Anthropic/Gemini 6/6, DOT 2/2) — re-verified by my own run.
- **ULM-17 logged (OPEN)** — eval surfaced that Gemini's `additionalProperties:false` is prompt-enforced only (ULM-14 sanitizer strips the keyword); didn't leak in the eval but the structural guarantee is absent. Disposition DIVERGE (documented sanitizer trade-off); follow-up = an adversarial extra-keys test.
- **ULM-15 DONE — LIVE-PROVEN** — refreshed Anthropic catalog (`claude-sonnet-4-20250514`→`claude-sonnet-4-6`, `claude-3-5-haiku-20241022`→`claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`; verified live on gateway); bumped smoke `max_tokens` 16→512 (reasoning models starved at 16); updated stale-id refs in catalog/resolver unit tests. The repo's **live** integration smoke suite now passes 9/9 (was 7 failing); mocked suite 676 green. `get_latest_model("anthropic")` → `claude-sonnet-4-6`.
- **DEAD-1 DONE** — investigated wiring `tool_output_limits`/`tool_line_limits` into `hooks-tool-truncation`: NO clean seam (the hook reads its own config; the `tool:post` event payload has no limits slot; wiring would need a new cross-module channel). Per "wire-it-or-delete-it / don't invent a channel," **deleted all 5 fields** (+ getters + orphaned constants) and documented the real control points in `config.py` (truncation → `hooks-tool-truncation` config; command timeouts → shell tool, see CAL-3/CAL-4). loop-agent 478 passed; 0 references remain in source/tests. (Plan said "wire the truncation pair"; reality said no clean seam, so delete+document — the honest outcome.)
- **ATX-8 DONE (wiring)** — `response_schema` node attribute added as backward-compatible extension (EXTENSIONS §23). Promoted in `graph.py`; resolved (inline JSON or file path) in `transforms.py`; fail-loud validation; threaded to `unified_llm.generate(response_format=ResponseFormat(json_schema=...))` on the direct-LLM path (`backend.py`, `__init__.py`); spawned-agent path **fails loud** ("only supported on direct-LLM nodes yet"). Structured result stored as `outcome.notes` + parsed into `context_updates[node.id]`. 30 tests; loop-pipeline 1360 passed. **Live end-to-end UNPROVEN (needs API keys).**
- **SYNC-1 DONE** — refreshed all three `specs/canonical/*-canonical.md` to upstream `fb57a55` (byte-identical). Working `specs/*.md` left as-is (they carry local edits documented in EXTENSIONS.md).
- **Extensions documented** — added `specs/EXTENSIONS.md` §16–22 for shipped-but-unspec'd attractor features (fail-fast routing/`runs_on`, I/O contracts `requires`/`outputs`, parallel `k_of_n`/`quorum`, human `freeform`, tool `parse_json`/`tool_env`, `$param`/`${key}`, `outcome`→`preferred_label`). ATX-5 cross-referenced.
- Ledger created.
